            <h3>What would you do differently?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">Build and maintain sources harder. I think our team started well, but the rapid cycle (holy shit can 30 minutes just evaporate when you&#x27;re trying to hit deadline) and eventually exhaustion took their toll. (And to be clear, I mean both for our media team and for the other players.) I would also love to play again as humans (any role) and as aliens.</div>

            <h3>What did you like the least?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">Almost too real. Also: had a serious shitty food hangover when I got home and the next day. (My own fault, and mostly a problem with getting old.) Seriously: Thank you so much for the veggie tray and meat and cheese tray and water container. Coffee and hot water/tea options would be very much appreciated next time. I understand not offering a full mid-day or evening meal. Would like to see more women and people of color helping run the game.</div>

            <h3>What did you like the most?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">Very real, but still a game I could have low-risk fun doing crazy things I&#x27;d never do in real life. Winning. Knowing so many people. Not knowing so many people. More women than I expected playing. Would like to have seen more people of color, but that is a problem endemic to our community.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="response-section">
            <h3>What could we have done better?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">I know the logistics are already insane, but some sort of deeper post-gave narrative than the relatively quick debrief and awards. A history of some sort of the events of that day. Hope the pictures and videos and notes all turn into something cool beyond advertising for the next event.</div>

        <div class="response-section">
            <h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">This is seriously burned into my psyche; one of the most intense but fun and low-risk experiences I&#x27;ve had since high school 20+ years ago. Reminded me of the best summer camps and immersion experiences. I imagine preparing for and running the game were everything I loved about being a camp counselor that one summer. I just loved it.</div>

            <div class="response-text">I felt the war room should have taken place at the end of the round. The fact that as aliens we had zero access to anything was upsetting. Especially given our terms of victory... how was an alien captured? Why couldn&#x27;t we capture anyone? Everyone else got a briefing prior to the start of the first round we waited five minutes in before being lead to our room and then spent 15 minutes getting settled finding everything out. If we were in the war room round one we would have had the same information as everyone else. We started at a total disadvantage. I feel we should have had information before game start. I don&#x27;t understand why we were separated. Our controllers and apparently the waroom controllers were not aware of how to handle certain things. We were essentially on a mission of peace but could only take hostile actiins.</div>

            <h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">There was one player in the alien team who was very committed to trying to play &quot;outside of the rules&quot;(not explicitly breaking them but violating the spirit of the game imo)and that affected some of my teammates enjoyment. I&#x27;m not sure how as an organizer you could deal discourage that but I think it would be a good idea. Overall I had a great time and I look forward to your next event!</div>

        <div class="response-section">
            <h3>What could we have done better?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">Four things come to mind. The logistics of the game made it difficult, specifically the physical distance between the aliens area and the main play area. I think this hindered our ability to respond to events and made it difficult for control (alien control, mail carriers, war room, and main control) to operate effectively.  Personally, I felt the alien team was forgotten about during the initial briefing time and missed out on the first round of the game. we were not brought to the alien area until approximately 10:20 and were briefed then. i felt we lost out on critical information initially and were playing catch-up because of it, especially in the war room. I was disappointed food/snacks were not provided in the alien area until very late in the game (3/4 pm) . I heard and saw snacks were available in the hall of nations, but was told entering the hall of nations as an alien would have an effect of the game (basically making it off limits unless you wanted to drastically alter the game narrative.) Lastly, I think game rules and rulings could have been worked out/handled better and in a more efficient manner. This is a moderate concern I have considering all the moving parts of a megagame and the sheer randomness of 50+ players makes this very difficult.</div>

        <div class="response-section">
            <h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
            <div class="response-text">I think this was a great time and a massive learning experience as a player and for the control team. I am sure feedback from players will guide your decision making for future games to improve the player experience. It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was a hell of a lot of fun to play!  I was not disappointed in the gaming experience and would most definitely play again in the genuinely exciting crazy chaos of another megagame!</div>

            <div class="response-text">Great job hosting this guys.  It was my first time playing a mega game, and definitely won&#x27;t be the last.  I also think that it might be more interesting to have different playable nations.  Keep the Big 3 (US, Russia, China), roll the Euro countries into the EU, and pick some interesting &quot;spoiler nations&quot; to make up the rest.  Bad state actors such as Iran, North Korea, etc.  Or maybe add some sort of asymmetrical human threat like ISIS.  Thanks guys!</div>
