## A Mega-What?

A **megagame** is a large multiplayer game involving teams of players. The subject matter can range from politics to economics—from history to science fiction. Much of what goes on could be described as roleplaying, though there's a large element of board gaming, problem solving, strategy, negotiation, and, of course, humor. Don't miss your chance to play in this unique, global phenomenon.

## What is a Megagame?

It's a 6+ hour, large-scale mix of role-playing, board gaming, diplomacy, and strategy. Most players will be on a team with other high-ranking members of a real-world country as they navigate not only their own aims, but those of the other countries and outside forces. All of the players are playing the same scenario, but each from different perspectives and roles. In this day-long event, you will carve a strategy with other players, play sub-games based on your role, and react to situations as they arise.

## How will I fit in?

Players are divided into teams of unique roles and responsibilities. Every role in the game has different responsibilities, ranging from handling international conflicts through military might to solving humanity's problems through careful planning and research. Each and every role is unique and every player will have a different experience on gameday, directly shaping the game itself through their actions.
