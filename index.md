## Welcome to Prairie Fire Gaming

We host and create **megagames**—massive, immersive events where dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of players come together for hours of strategy, diplomacy, and unforgettable chaos. If you've never heard of a megagame before, don't worry—most people haven't. Here's what you need to know:

## What is a Megagame?

It's a large-scale mix of role-playing, board gaming, diplomacy, and strategy—typically running several hours. Players are divided into teams or factions, each with their own goals and challenges. 

You might be on a team representing a real-world country, a clan of Dwarves working to secure its legacy, or a clandestine group of agents plotting to overthrow corporate overlords in a futuristic dystopia. Whatever the scenario, you'll be working with others to navigate not only your own aims, but those of the other factions and outside forces.

All of the players are playing the same scenario, but each from different perspectives and roles. You'll develop strategy with other players, play sub-games based on your role, and react to situations as they arise. Every role is unique, and every player will have a different experience on gameday, directly shaping the game itself through their actions.

Megagames can explore nearly anything—from history to science fiction, politics to fantasy, and everything in between.
