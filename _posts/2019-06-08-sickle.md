78 players took on the challenge of _Sickle: A Scythe Megagame_, our second megagame event that pushed the boundaries of strategic gameplay and player interaction.

**78 players, eight factions, and countless schemes in the diesel-punk world of 1920+**

Set in the alternate 1920+ universe created by Jakub Rozalski, players navigated the complex political, military, and economic landscape of Europa. Eight factions—the Rusviet Union, Republic of Polania, Saxon Empire, Nordic Kingdom, Crimean Khanate, the Factory, the Albion Expeditionary Force, and the Togawa Shogunate's Factory Task Force—vied for dominance through diplomacy, resource management, and the occasional deployment of towering diesel-punk mechs.

Players experienced the tension of managing national resources, negotiating treaties, designing fantastical technologies, and making decisions that could lead their nation to prosperity or ruin. From coups and conspiracies to land reform and industrial innovation, Sickle delivered hours of memorable political intrigue and strategic gameplay.
