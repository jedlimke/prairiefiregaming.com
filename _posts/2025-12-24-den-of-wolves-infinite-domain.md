60 players! 6 hours! 100% fun! Inspired by the pilot of Battlestar Galactica, Den of Wolves is a cooperative megagame that combines elements of board games and diplomacy.

Players cooperate to allocate resources while fending off waves of attacks from the vile "wolves". Beware! These wolves are tricky, and a traitor may roam amongst us.

**Infinite Domain** is an expansion to the original Den of Wolves which increases the player count and incorporates new ships as well as several bonus roles.
