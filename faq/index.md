# Frequently Asked Questions

##### What is a megagame?

A megagame is a large-scale social game that blends elements of role-playing, strategy, and board game mechanics. These immersive events typically run for 4-8 hours and can accommodate anywhere from 30 to 200 players. Think of it as a hybrid between a tabletop game, a LARP, and a Model UN simulation—but way more fun.

​

##### Who can play a megagame?

Anyone! Most of our games are appropriate for ages 16 and up, though some games may have different age requirements. We encourage anyone interested to reach out if you have questions about a specific game.

​

##### When is your next game?

Check out our [Megagames page](../megagames/) for upcoming events! We announce new games via email, our social media channels, and on this website.

​

##### I missed out on a game, will you run the same one again?

We do our best to accommodate the maximum number of players at our games. If there's enough interest and demand, we'll absolutely consider running the same game multiple times. Sign up for our email list to be notified when we announce repeat runs.

​

##### Do I have to have a group of friends to play a megagame?

Not at all! While some games have team-based structures, we always do our best to accommodate solo players. Many of our players come alone and make friends during the event. Part of the megagame magic is meeting new people who share your love of epic storytelling and strategic gameplay.

​

##### What information can I expect about the game?

When you register for a game, you'll receive a confirmation email with initial details. Roughly 2-3 weeks before the event, you'll be emailed your role assignment, a copy of the rules, and any other resources you need to prepare. Some games require minimal prep, while others benefit from some advance reading—we'll always be clear about expectations.

​

##### I don't see my accessibility needs catered for, but I still want to play. What should I do?

Please let us know! We're passionate about bringing megagames to as wide an audience as possible, and we're always willing to work on solutions. Review our [Accessibility & Accommodations policy](../policies/accessibility/) and reach out to us at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com) to discuss your specific needs.

​

##### How can I get involved in helping run games?

We love passionate volunteers! The best way to get involved is to play a game first, then chat with us afterward about your interest in crewing or game running. You can also reach out directly at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com).

​

##### I want to design a game, can you help?

Yes! We're always interested in supporting new designers. Whether you need playtesting, production support, or just advice, get in touch. We can discuss how Prairie Fire Gaming might be able to help bring your megagame vision to life.

​

##### I wrote a megagame, will you run it?

Probably yes! We love new megagames. Please get in touch at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com) and we can discuss our process for reviewing and potentially producing new games.

​

##### What should I bring to a megagame?

Check out our [For Players](../for-players/) page for a comprehensive guide! The basics: yourself, an open mind, snacks/drinks, and a pen. We'll provide everything else you need to play.

​

##### What are your COVID-19 safety protocols?

We follow current CDC guidelines and local venue requirements. If you're feeling unwell, please stay home—we'll work with you on refunds or transfers. Check our [Safety Policy](../policies/safety-policy/) for more details.
