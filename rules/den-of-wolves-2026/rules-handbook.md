**About the Game**** **

Introduction 

Den of Wolves is a game about the interactions between politics and survival during a time of crisis. Players represent the ships in the “Survivor Fleet” – a group of surviving ships fleeing from a catastrophic attack by a ruthless enemy. These ships are trying to survive in the midst of a crisis. Some players are civilians whilst others are representing government and military elements of the fleet. This game is about interactions between all of these different entities as they attempt to survive. 

The game blends both 'Political' (talking and negotiating) and 'Operational' (decisions, units and resources) gameplay. Some roles are exclusively Political, while others have a much greater focus on Operational matters. In general, players should expect a significant amount of resource management and player-to-player negotiation and discussion, with a small amount of unit positioning and combat. 

Rules 

As with many megagames, in Den of Wolves, there are some relatively simple rules that give the game some framework and give players some universal expectations about the nature of the gameplay – but these are not the totality of the game. As part of the simulation, players have freedom to suggest actions to Control not covered by the game rules. If reasonable, Control will typically give you the opportunity to do/try it at some cost and/or risk of failure. 

Keep in mind, however, that while there is this flexibility in how you play the game – Den of Wolves is not a game where 'anything goes'. Random acts, doing things 'just for laughs' or 'just because you can', will have the same impact that such behaviour would have in the real world. So be careful – every action has reactions and unintended consequences. 

Setting 

This game is set several hundred years in the future. Space cruisers and advanced technologies are relatively commonplace. But the Sci-Fi setting does not mean that solutions will come from fantastical technological developments. Don't expect a new type of time-travel laser to come along and solve all of your problems. 

Instead, the setting is intended to give a fresh feeling and exciting launching point for a semirealistic simulation of a complicated political and operational situation. If you keep this in mind, you will likely have a much more enjoyable time playing Den of Wolves. 

Humanity itself is much the same as today. Similar to how both today and hundreds of years ago, society is/was a mixture of complex, interconnected authorities, powers and factions, with shifting loyalties and different perspectives, the same is true for the setting here. Different played factions in this game have particular perspectives and goals – these will be explained in the Background Guide – otherwise, act how you would act as a person in the modern world. 

**Game Intent**

You will be provided with some objectives in your briefing. You may notice that most of them sound somewhat vague and flexible. This is intentional. Your objectives should give you an idea of the needs, wants, and goals for your character and your team. Use them to inform your choices and your roleplay. With these grander objectives in mind, you can determine your own personal specific goals as the game goes on, and may find them naturally changing throughout the day. 

The intent of this game is to create an approximate realistic simulation with an organic shared narrative that everyone contributes to by playing. At the end of the day there will be no scores, rewards or rankings for your objectives. There is no way for any player to 'win' or 'lose' this game. At the end of the game, you should consider your own performance based on how well you feel you've met your objectives. 

**Playing the Game **

Megagames are huge, chaotic and confusing by nature. This will be the same for everyone, and a feeling of being slightly overwhelmed is completely normal. However, you can't go far wrong as long as you keep talking to people. Megagames are as much about communication and negotiation as they are about what you do with your resources and units. The game mechanisms are designed to facilitate this communication – however your activities are your own, and as such, the best way to engage with the game is to be proactive, and look for opportunities to talk to others. 

One other thing that is important to know is that in a megagame, unlike in many types of games, you are not the Hero of the Story. You are just one important part in a giant exercise in collective storytelling – with an emphasis on the 'collective'. Please keep this in mind, and resist the urge to do things that are disruptive or outrageous purely for the sake of ego. That generally doesn't end well, or make for an entertaining day for you or the other players. 

**Acknowledgements** 

I would like to give thanks to all the people designing and running megagames, for without their efforts I wouldn't have known where to start with designing 'Den of Wolves'!

**Infinite Domain**

This rulebook has been modified from the original Den of Wolves to include Infinite Domain content. There is a new nation, 3 new ships with unique action cards and abilities, and several new “solo” roles that are brand new or inspired by previous runs of Den of Wolves. There are also rules changes and clarifications. If you’ve played Den of Wolves before, this should all look mostly familiar to you, and is mostly unchanged from the original game. 

**Game Structure**

Timetable

Each turn takes 30 minutes and depending on the group running your session, a full game of Den of Wolves will generally last from 5 to 8 hours total and include between 9 and 15 turns. There may or may not be a mid game break for lunch! The team running your game will let you know.

Game Layout 

In addition to this handbook you may be provided with a map of the game's layout on the day. Generally, there will be:

A table for each ship, along with sufficient seating for its crew.
A large table where the Council meets. Functionally within the game world, this is aboard The Dione.
A large table where the Fleet Map resides and where the space battle part of Wolf attacks are resolved.
A table for the Media team to sit at while they prepare their News report each round. Many sessions of Den of Wolves include audio/visual resources, and if present, these will be stationed close to the Media table. 
A table for the supply of Resources, additional unit and crew tokens, Riot cards, along with other shared materials such as pens, paper, etc.
A sequestered area for the Control team, sometimes referred to as the Moderators or Game Runners to keep supplies for the game. This is off limits to all players. 

There will be an orientation to the game’s venue provided during the initial briefing at the beginning of the event. 

Honour System

When generating resources or creating new crew or units on ships, players are expected to gather those resources from the table where the resources are held. This does not require the use of a Shuttle as the resources are thematically being generated on the ship itself. This is done on the honour system. There is no incentive to cheat at Megagames, no one “wins” or “loses” these types of games. If you cheat, you’re only making the game less challenging and less fun for yourself. 

**Note on inconsistency in terminology** - “Damaged” and “Wounded” are essentially the same thing; Squadron Units are Damaged, Crew and On-Foot Units are Wounded, both have similar status indicators as well as mechanics for being repaired/healed. “Vessel” and “Ship” are the same thing. “Turn” and “Round” are somewhat interchangeable, but combat “rounds” have a specific meaning outlined in the section on Combat. These inconsistencies will be changed in future versions of this game. When in doubt about the interpretation of a rule, ask a member of Control.

**Sequence of Action **

The game will progress in a series of turns. Each turn will take approximately 30 minutes of real time. Control will be keeping track of this and will announce when phases end. Each turn has two main parts: 

1. Action Phase (18 mins) In this phase players can move ships and units, exchange resources or crew, activate stations, or any number of things. 

This is also the time when the Interstellar Council will hold its meetings. 

During this phase, Wolf Attacks may happen at any time. 

2. Team Phase (12 mins) You must return to your team. You will be expected to return to your team's table except for when there are extreme circumstances that would mean you would not do so (for example, if you were detained on another ship). In all other situations, you must return to your team table and remain there for the duration of this phase. (Feel free to move for calls of nature or any other non-game reason). 

Players catch up on events, plan for the next turn and discuss any internal political issues. 

Towards the end of this phase you will hear a News Broadcast from the Media team. IMPORTANT - We ask that you give the Media your undivided attention while they are speaking. This is important because they will be providing insight into what is happening on a game-wide scale and give you information you may not have heard about during your turn. It may be difficult to hear them if there are other people talking during this. It’s also a tricky job getting in front of a bunch of people, and they deserve your attention and respect for it! After the News, you’ll update your Morale Track, and roll for Riots, if necessary.

**Player Roles** 

Players in this game represent the senior roles in both civilian government and in command of the fleet's various starships. Note that players are not necessarily limited to the responsibilities detailed here – teams can delegate what they need to. Remember that any role can be of use by seeking out and/or delivering information on the wider situation. 

Captain 

Each ship has a captain who is responsible for the safety of the ship and those within it. A captain has the final say on all major decisions for their own ship, however they are reliant on the other members of their crew to keep them informed and advise them on important events and issues. They are also responsible for taking command of the ship’s security forces while the First Officer is otherwise indisposed. 

First Officer 

The first officer on a ship is the captain's second-in-command, assisting the captain in their duties as necessary, and will take over command of the ship for periods when the captain is absent or incapacitated. The First Officer on civilian ships is also responsible for security, and has direct control over any security forces (and for ships that have them, their Weapon Batteries and Fighter Squadrons). The First Officer is also responsible for the crew (represented by Crew counters) – ensuring they are safe, that the ship has enough of them, and keeping track of any crew moved to other ships. 

Council Member / Diplomat

The council member represents their nation’s citizens at the Interstellar Council. Council members will be expected to attend the council each turn to discuss larger matters, make decisions and pass laws. Each team has a majority population from a specific nation that they will be representing. These players represent the legislative branch of the government. The Diplomat is a junior member of the Council from the fledgling nation of Helvetii. At the start of the game, they are able to speak at the council but do not get a vote. 

Chief Engineer 

The chief engineer has the important responsibility of keeping the ship running. It is their primary focus that the ship is kept in working condition, and gets all the food, water, fuel and materials it needs to keep running and its people supplied. They are also ultimately responsible for the ship’s shuttle, if they have one. 

Chief Surgeon/Scientist/Warden 

There are a handful of smaller, specialist ships in the survivor fleet that have smaller teams. These consist of a captain and a role that is suited to the ship's specialty. Typically the captain will be responsible for the larger decisions whilst the specialist will be responsible for the regular actions in the ship – though responsibilities may be delegated to either based on necessity. 

The Star Alpha 

The team on the Star Alpha is different to other teams, as it is based on the President's entourage rather than management of the ship (which is relatively tiny compared to the other ships in the fleet). This team has the President, the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, and the Parliamentarian. They represent the executive branch of the government.

Arbourist

The Arbourist is a solo player who represents the charismatic leader of a new religious movement. They do not have a ship whose crew they are part of. They are welcome to move around the room during team time and sit with whichever ship invites them to. 

Inquisitor

The Inquisitor is a solo player who is the sole survivor of humanity’s judicial system. They have investigatory abilities that help in their mission to root out traitors against humanity. They begin the game stationed on the Star Alpha but have broad access to all ships and may spend team time aboard any ship of their choosing. 

Firebrand

The Firebrand is a formerly incarcerated political radical whose sentence is up and has just been released. Their reputation as someone willing to sacrifice everything for what their believe in and who stood up for the common person has been etched in stone during their imprisonment, which many among the fleet believe was unjustified. A polarizing figure, they continue to advocate for the workers and voice their distrust of the current unelected government.

The Aegis 

The ICSS Aegis is a massive military ship and as such it functions differently to the civilian ships of the fleet in a number of ways, including in its team make-up. The Admiral and XO (Executive Officer), function as captain and first officer, respectively. They also have a Comms Officer for communicating with the rest of the fleet, a Logistics Officer for managing the Aegis' requirements and a Commander - Air Group (CAG) who is responsible for all of the Aegis' Fighter squadrons. Finally, they have a Council Liaison who is able to speak on behalf of the Admiral at the Council, but does not have voting power.

News Media 

The media are represented by a News Media team (acting as the Interstellar News Corporation). These players are representing the wider Interstellar news media elements within the fleet as a whole rather than individuals. As such they can move freely in order to gather as much news as possible, and do not have a specific location in the game like other players. The News Media team will put out a broadcast at the end of each turn. As well as the obvious effects of public praise or criticism, this broadcast can have a direct impact on morale. 

Note that (non-News Media) players are not allowed to make room-wide announcements – so the ability of the News Media team to broadcast to everyone in the room is significant. If you want to make a room wide announcement, you must work with the News Media team to do so. 

**Morale Tracks**
❌
Each team has a Morale Track, which represents the happiness, health and stability of the crew and civilians on the ship. 

Updates

During the Team Phase of each turn, after the news broadcast has been delivered and you have received its effect from Control (see below), you must immediately roll a D6 to Update your Morale Track. 

Take the number rolled on the die and modify it based on these factors: 

-1	Per damage taken to your ship this turn (per 3 damage for the Aegis) 
-1 	Per Wolf Boarding Party unit that was on your ship at any point during the turn 
+4	Food/Water supplied at Luxurious Rations level this turn 
+2	Food/Water supplied at Increased Rations level this turn 
+0	Food/Water supplied at Normal Rations level this turn 
-1	Food/Water supplied at Low Rations level this turn 
-2	Food/Water supplied at Minimum Rations level this turn
-4	Food/Water supplied at Critical Rations level this turn 
-6	No Food/Water Supplied this turn 
(Note that Food and Water supplied are two separate modifiers so a ship on Low Food Rations and Critical Water Rations would take a combined -5 to their roll) 
+/-?	News Coverage from INC (Control will tell you this immediately after each broadcast) 

13 or more 	Morale Track rises two levels 
7 to 12 	Morale Track rises one level 
1 to 6 		No change to Morale Track
0 to -3 		Morale Track drops one level 
-4 or less 	Morale Track drops two levels 

There are sections on all ship mats outlining the Morale mechanic along with instructions on Riots.

Your Morale Track can also go up or down abruptly if a relevant major event occurs. Control will inform you if this happens. 

If a ship's Morale Track ever reaches zero, then the ship will be in a state of anarchy with all aboard panicking or in open rebellion against the captain. Control will talk with you if this happens.

There may be other modifiers for morale, for example from station effects, action cards or relevant events that occur (Control will advise).

Immediately after making a morale roll, each ship will make a roll for riots, if necessary. See the Riots section. 

Fleet Morale 

Certain major events will affect 'Fleet Morale' as a whole, such as ships being destroyed or separated from the fleet, or major political events. Certain stations and action cards may also affect Fleet Morale. If 'Fleet Morale' increases or decreases, this means all ships' morale tracks will go up or down by that amount. 
**The Interstellar Council **

The Interstellar Council has 7 permanent members and 1 junior member. These include one representative from each of the 6 major interstellar powers – the FAS, the CPA, the SAN, Rosal, Proxima and Gliese – and the Parliamentarian (nominally under the jurisdiction of The President). The Helvetii Diplomat sits with the Council but does not start the game with voting power. This is an issue that their Diplomat would like addressed sooner rather than later. 

As the civilian government, the council can make, amend and repeal laws for the survivor fleet. These laws are official and legally binding for everyone in the fleet – though of course players have the choice to go against the law. If it is necessary to enforce these laws then how this is done is up to the players (most likely the President and Vice President). The council can also choose to be responsible for making certain major decisions or to debate important topics not related specifically to law-making.

The President and Vice President serve as the executive branch for the implementation and arbitration of laws. The military, and by extension the Admiral and all those serving aboard the ICSS Aegis and ICSS Javelin, are legally bound to follow the instruction of the President. As the President is not above the law, they are expected to act as directed by the Council and the laws. However, in extreme and urgent circumstances, where it is deemed reasonable that there would not be time to consult the Council for a decision, the President can give orders directly to the admiral. Improper usage of this power may result in serious legal charges. 

Council Rules

The Parliamentarian is responsible for writing legislation and is also a voting member of the Council. Proposed legislation requires a majority vote from the Council to advance to the President. In cases of a tie, the Vice President must cast the tie breaking vote. This is the only time the Vice President may vote on legislation. The President must sign the legislation to make it Law. If the President does not sign the legislation or vetoes it, it returns to the Council. A Veto can be overridden with a 5/7ths vote of the Council. 

Once a Law is passed and signed, it will be posted near the Council table for public review. Afterwards, the Law should be enforced by the relevant parties. If not otherwise specified, Laws are enforced by the President, Vice President, and Chief of Staff. If Laws go unenforced, the citizens of the fleet will begin to think there is no rule of law, which will hurt Morale.

Any type of legislation may be passed, but keep in the mind the following:

**Legislation should be enforceable.** 
If laws are passed that cannot be enforced, it will negatively affect Morale. For example: “All wolves will be executed.” will do nothing to solve the problem if Wolves can’t be identified. The public wants actual solutions, not lip service.

**The Council should make sure their laws are followed.**
If laws are passed that are not enforced, it will negatively affect Morale rolls. For example: “The Captain of the Dione will be detained in the Brig on suspicion of being a Wolf.” is excellent legislation. However, if nobody arrests the Captain and detains them, then the public will begin to doubt the government’s control. 

While Council members cannot write legislation on their own, once per game each Council member can call for a vote of “no confidence” against the Parliamentarian. If there is a majority, the Parliamentarian is stripped of their office to become a regular Council member, and no further legislation may be proposed until a new Parliamentarian is elected. All Council members are considered to be a candidate for the new Parliamentarian, and a simple plurality is required (the candidate who received the most votes, not necessarily a majority) to become the new Parliamentarian. Council members can also call for a “Snap Election” of a new President. It requires a 5/7ths vote, and can only happen once per game. Unlike other elections, all players are allowed to vote for President from among the current Council members, and a simple plurality wins. The new President then names a new Vice President.

Control will adjudicate any role changes that occur due to an election. 

Under the normal timetable of the Council, there would not be an election for another two and a half years - well after the time frame of the game. However, the situation the survivor fleet finds itself in is not normal circumstances. The vast majority of the Council (including the president) are recent appointees, with the current Council having been set up in a hurry to meet the needs of the crisis. Things are certainly more flexible in the survivor fleet than they were before The Attack. Though players should keep in mind that any sudden or radical political changes risk exacerbating an already difficult situation. 

The Council meets in closed session and only the News Media may be present during deliberation. Other players may be present with the permission of the Council. Only the 8 Council members may actually speak at the Council unless given permission by the Council. Players are free to ask questions of the Council members after the meeting has officially ended. 

Council Player Abilities

President: The leader of the executive branch. Their duty is to uphold and enforce the Laws of the Council. They are also the civilian leader of the military and the Aegis should report to them.

**Special power: Presidential Veto** 
The President signs legislation into Law. When Council passes legislation it requires the President’s signature. If the President does not sign it or vetoes it, it does not become Law. A Presidential Veto can be overridden by the Council with a 5/7ths vote.

Vice President: The second-in-command of the executive branch. Their duty is to uphold and enforce the laws of the legislature. Chain of command states that they become President if the current President is killed, incapacitated, or unable to fulfill their duty. 

**Special power: Tiebreaker**
The Vice President does not vote in Council unless there is a tie. They break ties.

Parliamentarian: The leader of the legislative branch. Their duty is to maintain control of the Council and pass sensible and enforceable legislation for the good of the fleet. They control the language of the legislation and what legislation is brought to a vote. They are also considered a voting member of the Council.

**Special power: Legislative Control**
The Parliamentarian is the only player with the ability to write legislation and bring legislation to a vote. 

**Resources and Units** 

Resources must be kept in the Storage Hold of a ship, or on a Shuttle – unless specified otherwise, players cannot hold resources on their person (e.g. keeping them in pockets). Depending on the group running the game, these resources may be represented by different components. Game Control will be sure to make it clear what is what.
❌
Strytium Ore 

Strytium Ore has no practical use on its own, but can be refined into the highly valuable Strytium Fuel. Strytium Ore is represented by red cubes or crystals. 

❌

Strytium fuel is the fuel used in almost all starship FTL drives. It contains a massive amount of chemical energy. A ship will be unable to perform a standard FTL jump if it does not have enough Strytium Fuel for it (though there are other options). Strytium Fuel is represented by red counters or chips. 

❌

Food is an essential resource for survival. As such, most larger starships were designed with the capability to grow enough food to sustain their own crew. Unfortunately for the survivor fleet, most of of its ships cannot survive on the food and water they alone produce, as almost all of the ships in the fleet are over their intended passenger capacity after picking up survivors in smaller ships that had to be abandoned. Food is represented by green counters or chips. 

Water 
❌
Water isn't just necessary for drinking, but is also required for basic hygiene – showering, washing and cleaning. The less a ship has, the worse the morale situation becomes. Water is also necessary for the production of food, making it all the more critical to ensure that there's enough water to go round. Water is represented by blue counters or chips. 

❌

❌

❌

There are two types of Squadron – Space Fighter Squadrons and Boarding Squadrons. Space Fighters are often military craft, though some of the larger and more expensive civilian ships in the fleet have a small complement for security. The fleet has no Boarding Squadrons – these are used by the Wolf forces to attack the fleet's ships from within.

On-Foot Unit 
❌
There are many reasons why combat is seen on the decks within a starship, and so all military starships have some number of marines onboard. On civilian ships, especially larger ones or those that perform longer voyages, private security is common. Marines, private security, and boarding parties are all considered to be the same “type” of unit for rules purposes. Units are not Crew and vice versa.

Crew 
❌
In the survivor fleet, everyone is pitching in to keep the fleet going. Crew are needed to operate the stations in all ships. Crew can be moved between ships (using Shuttles), but only if they are not in a 'used' state (face down) and if it is allowed explicitly by the ship's captain (or current commander). Crew counters must always be placed on a specific station on a ship (they cannot be held on a player's person, or just left on the table in no specific location). For more information on Crew, see the 'Stations and Crew' section. 
❌
Trained Crew: Some stations and other game effects require crew with specific training to operate them. This training can be provided by certain ships using action cards. When a crew counter has been successfully trained, the counter is replaced by a new crew counter that bears a symbol related to the specialty of their training. 

Trained crew can operate stations that are normally operated by untrained crew. 

Transport Shuttles 

The fleet has hundreds of small shuttles that can move individuals around with ease. However, for large amounts of people or resources, much larger craft are required. There are a limited number of these Shuttles, as only a few ships in the fleet have them. 

Resources, On-Foot Units, and Crew can only be moved from ship to ship in a Shuttle. 

There is no limit on how many journeys a Shuttle can make in a turn. However, keep in mind that by placing resources/units/crew in a Shuttle, or taking them from a Shuttle, the relevant ship would have to dock with it. This doesn’t affect any of the standard game mechanisms – but it might become relevant depending on how events unfold. 

Legally, Chief Engineers are responsible for Shuttles owned by their ship, as well as the operations of any Shuttles on their ship (regardless of owner). However, for the purposes of the game, there is no restriction on which member of a team is permitted to control the Shuttle.
**Stations and Crew** 
❌
Each ship in the fleet is made up of a number of stations. These are represented on your ship panel by playing-card sized boxes. Each station can be operated by “using” Crew counters (turn the counter face down to represent that it has been used). Note that the effects of some stations, (such as Jump Drives) are time-specific, and so can only be operated if Crew counters were “used” on them at the beginning of the turn. There is reminder text IN RED on these stations to remind you to do this **AT THE START** of the turn. At the beginning of Phase 2 (the Team Phase), all crew return to being unused (are turned face up). 

❌

When a ship takes damage, this means that it draws a random Damage Card. Each ship’s Damage card deck is located at that ship’s table. The card is then placed over the station it pertains to (if there are multiple identical stations, determine which one at random). The card will show the effects of the damage – both any instant effects (represented by the exclamation mark symbol) and any ongoing effects (represented by the circular arrow symbol). Instant effects happen a single time, as soon as you draw the card, and won't have any further effect (unless the station is repaired and then damaged again). Ongoing effects continue until the station is repaired. 

Players can look through their own (not another team's) ship's Damage Card deck at any time. However, they must then shuffle the deck before it is next used. 

Unless otherwise stated on the Damage Card, a damaged station is always unable to perform its regular function until it is repaired. 

The damaged station card also shows its repair cost. This will be the use of engineer crew and the spending of materials. 

When a station is damaged, all crew (used and unused) located inside it become wounded. 

Wounded Crew 
❌
When a crew (trained or untrained) is wounded, this is indicated by drawing a red stripe across it. Red dry erase markers will be provided for this.

Wounded crew *cannot be used*. Wounded crew can be returned to normal using a sickbay station or certain action cards. Whenever a wounded crew is in a situation where they would become wounded again, they are lost permanently instead. When a wounded crew is healed, they are considered used for that turn and can’t be used to activate stations, etc, until the next turn.

**The Fleet Map** 
❌
In the middle of the room there is a map of the survivor fleet. The map represents how the fleet is laid out relative to the Aegis, and therefore the Aegis is always in the centre. The map is used to represent the tactical positions of both Fighter squadrons and the civilian ships. 

The fleet map is separated into 4-6 quadrants (depending on the overall player count) that represent the space around the Aegis. Ships and Fighter squadrons can be moved freely on the map during the action phase by the relevant players. For ships this is the captain (or current commander), and for Fighter squadrons this will be the Aegis' CAG and a handful of First Officers from civilian ships with Fighter squadrons. 

Only players with direct command of ships or Fighter units may approach the fleet map. 

Only a certain number of ships can be in any quadrant, however, as indicated on the map itself. Each quadrant has five spaces, and all ships take up either one or two of these spaces. Vessels cannot move into a quadrant where there isn't room for them. 

Only which quadrant a ship is in is important – there is no significance to which space a ship occupies within the quadrant itself. Vessels are not allowed to position themselves within a quadrant to block other ships from being able to “fit” in the spaces there – they must move within the quadrant to allow enough spaces if they can. 

Any disagreements about which quadrants ships will be located in will have to be resolved between players in whatever manner they decide. 

Two ships can “swap” places if the commanders are in agreement – there is no need to shift ships around to a third location. 

Any quadrant can be moved to from any other quadrant – they are all functionally adjacent for movement purposes. Quadrants 5 and 6 are added if using Infinite Domain content.

❌

Also visible beside the fleet map is the Pursuit Track. This represents how close the majority of the pursuing Wolf naval forces are to reaching the survivor fleet's current position. This increases by one at the end of each turn. Each time the fleet jumps further away, the track drops by one, two or three for a Short, Medium or Long jump, respectively. Other relevant events may have an effect on the track. The higher the track is, the greater the strength of the Wolf forces involved in any Wolf Attack that appears. Note that the Pursuit Track has no effect on the likelihood of a Wolf Attack – Wolf scouts are everywhere and could discover the Fleet at any time!
**Wolf Attack** 

Wolf scouts are searching all over space for the Survivor Fleet, and there is no telling when the Fleet's exact location will be discovered and the closest elements of the Wolf's pursuing forces will jump in to attack. Note that the higher the Pursuit Track position, the greater the strength of the Wolf forces that will appear. 

At any time during the action phase, a Wolf Attack may begin. This represents the forward elements of the Wolf naval pursuit forces finding and reaching the survivor fleet. 

As soon as a Wolf Attack is announced by Control, all players must immediately cease their movement around the room. Players must remain at whatever table they were currently at (as they are unable to leave the ship whilst the attack is ongoing). During this time, players may communicate between tables using their phones or written messages passed by Control. Players may NOT talk to players on other tables. 

The only exceptions to this are players in charge of their ships' weapon batteries and Fighter Squadrons. All of these players must immediately take all Fighter squadron units previously placed in the Battle Stations section of their ship mat and report to the fleet map to respond to the attack. 

For the duration of a Wolf attack players are also immediately forbidden from moving any crew or resources between ships. The only player movement that is allowed is the movement of on-foot units after the first round of combat, as described below.

Wolf Attack Player Summary

The following players must report to the map when a Wolf Attack is announced: 
Aegis Admiral

All other players must remain at the tables they were currently at.

A number of Wolf Fighter Squadrons and Boarding Squadrons will appear in one or more quadrants. (If the pursuit track is particularly high, there is a chance that larger Wolf combat ships may also appear). 

The Wolf Attack will then proceed with alternating 'Fleet' and 'Wolf' rounds, beginning with a Fleet round. 

In Fleet rounds, all Fleet combat units activate, in Wolf rounds, all Wolf combat units activate. 

In any Fleet round other than the first, ships can make an FTL jump. If all the ships in the fleet jump, all Wolf units (other than those already boarded on a fleet ship) are removed from the map. All Fleet fighter units are automatically returned to their owning ship immediately if it jumps. Note that communication is, as described above, quite limited during a Wolf Attack, so being able coordinate an entire fleet-wide FTL jump would require some planning.

❌

**Fleet Fighter Squadrons:** Each Fleet round, each squadron may either move to another quadrant or attack Wolf units in its own quadrant. If it attacks, roll a D6 (six-sided die) and consult the table to the right - 


Whenever a fleet fighter squadron unit is damaged or destroyed, one Pilot-trained crew in the owning ship's hangar bay becomes wounded – however this wound is not resolved until after the Wolf Attack is finished. *Remember* - if a wounded or damaged unit is wounded or damaged again, they are lost permanently.

❌

Deal damage to Wolf units in the same quadrant as the ship that is using the Weapon Battery. *Reminder:* The Aegis is considered to be in ALL quadrants. 

**Wolf Fighter Squadrons:** Each Wolf round, each squadron will attack a random target in its quadrant. On a roll of 1-5 the squadron attacks one of the civilian ships as indicated on the fleet map (if an empty space is targeted, they attack the Aegis). On a 6 they attack the Aegis. Each unit immediately does one damage to its target. Use dice or suitable counters to keep track of each ship’s damage during attacks. This damage will be resolved at the ship tables after space combat is complete. 

**Wolf Boarding Squadrons:** In the first Wolf round, any surviving Wolf Boarding Squadrons that were not destroyed by the fleet’s fighter squadrons or weapon batteries will deal 1 damage to the ship they target and then disappear from the map and add one Wolf Boarding Unit to the ship that they target. Game Control will distribute these boarders and place them on the Battle Stations section of the ships they land on. 

*At this point, the Aegis XO and Javelin XO may return to their ship/s to help coordinate the shuttling of reinforcements to ships where boarders have landed. *
❌
**Fleet On-Foot Units:** Each Fleet round, each marine or security unit placed in Battle Stations may attack Wolf boarding units in the same ship. Roll a D6 and consult the table to the right. The Aegis' Marine units get a +2 to their attack rolls due to their superior equipment and training. 

**Note: **Units placed in the Ready Room AT THE START of the turn get a +1 bonus to their first die roll against boarders.

An On-Foot unit may instead embark in a Shuttle and can travel to another ship to fight there, however, they may not fight until the next Fleet round after they arrive. This means that certain players in charge of their ship’s shuttle (generally, the Chief Engineer) may move about the room for this purpose.

**Wolf Boarding Unit (On-Foot):** Each Wolf round, each Boarding unit deals 1 damage to the ship they are on. You can either use dice or suitable counters to keep track of each ship’s damage during attacks, or draw cards from the Damage Deck and keep them face down until after the attack is over. 
❌

❌

**Note:** Damaged Units can still fight, but damaged Crew cannot be used until they are healed at a Sickbay or through other means. 

Damage to a unit is indicated by drawing a red stripe across it. Red dry erase markers will be provided by Control for this purpose.

Notes on Units

Combat has been somewhat simplified in this version of Den of Wolves. All fleet units use the same damage tables. In older versions of this game, the amounts of damage dealt was different for different units (and weapon batteries), even if they rolled the same die result. This caused confusion for some players and made the game harder to teach. 

Units cannot be used to activate Stations, only Crew will do that. 

Units can be used as part of freeform actions and Control will adjudicate this with you. Keep in mind that they still must follow movement rules: they can only be onboard a ship, or in a shuttle. They can’t be put in your pocket or carried in your hand. These are platoon-sized complements of people and equipment and thematically wouldn’t fit in the personal shuttles that players use to move independently between ships.

**FTL Travel** 

❌

Destination Cards 

The Aegis team always draws one destination card at the beginning of each turn. They can also spend 3 fuel to draw a new Destination card at any time using a specific action card. There are other ways for certain players to gain additional Destination cards. 

Each destination card has a location on it including potential risks and benefits, as well as the FTL jump distance. There are three distance types – Short, Medium, and Long. Each ship has a specific fuel cost for each distance, as given on its ship panel. 

Each destination also has a specific 5-digit set of coordinates. For a ship to reach the destination, it must jump with those exact coordinates entered onto its Jump sheet.

Destination cards are held between turns. However, when the Aegis jumps, any team that has them must discard all their currently held destination cards. 

FTL Jumps 

At any time during the action phase (with one exception – see the 'Wolf Attack' section) any ship in the fleet can do an FTL jump. When a ship jumps, its captain (or current commander) must hold up their 'Jump' indicator sheet with coordinates written on the back – Control will then resolve the result. 

If multiple ships choose to jump, and have enough fuel and the same coordinates, they will all arrive at the new location without issue. However, if any of the ships won't or can't jump for any reason, they may become separated from the fleet. This could have numerous consequences that will become clear if such an event happens. Similarly, one or more ships can make an FTL jump on their own, without the rest of the fleet. In that case they will also be separated from the rest of the fleet, in the same manner as above. 

FTL Jumps can be done without coordinates. If a ship jumps without a specific set of coordinates, then it jumps to a random empty point in space that it can reach. 

Rewards from the Destination Card are placed on the Fleet Map and their distribution will be adjudicated by Control at the map. A majority of the fleet’s ships must arrive at the same coordinates in order for Rewards to “spawn”.

**Emergency Jump:** In the event of an emergency where a ship is separated from the Aegis or from the main body of the fleet and may not have the required fuel, an FTL Jump can be achieved by re-routing the vast amounts of power required through other systems. This is only used as a desperate measure, as it forces the rest of the ship's systems to shut down. If a ship does this, none of its other stations besides the Jump Drive can be operated that turn. A number of stations may also be damaged by the jump. Control will adjudicate this with you if it happens.
**Vessel Privacy** 

For the benefit of the game, each ship's hold and the detailed workings of what kinds of stations each ship has are visible on their ship panel. If players wish, they can keep these details secret by hiding their ship panel from players not on their team (e.g. by covering them with sheets of paper). This would represent your security staff actively preventing people from other ships looking around in most of the ship – so consider the potential impacts of this. 

Everyone in the fleet is aware of the basic details about every ship – these are given in the Background Guide. 

Each ship’s Storage Hold space on their ship mat is considered to be secure. You may not touch any components in another ship’s Storage Hold. Theft can be part of this game, but must be adjudicated by Control as a freeform action rather than done independently by players. 

❌

Each team will start with a number of Action Cards. There are many of these in the game, and they have a wide range of effects. What each action card does specifically will be explained on the card itself. Most cards deal directly with the mechanics of the game – though there are a few that are instead related to more freeform elements of the game. If you have any questions about how these cards might work, just ask Control. 

Action Cards can be exchanged freely to anyone within the same ship team. It is up to the team to decide how the cards are distributed. 

Action Cards can never be exchanged between different teams, unless the card itself says otherwise. 

❌

❌

**Riots** 
❌
❌

❌

If a riot appears, then it is placed on a random undamaged station (you can use the station Damage Cards to determine which station it appears on – note however that no damage is being done). 

A station with a Riot cannot be used that turn, even after the riot is dispersed. (To keep track of this, if a riot is dispersed, flip it face down rather than removing it. It can then be removed at the beginning of Phase 2.) 

Riot Propagation 

For each riot that spends an entire turn without any unit attempting to disperse it (whether successful or not), roll a D6 at the end of the turn, and on a 1, 2 or 3, place another riot on another random undamaged station. 

Dispersing Riots 

During the action phase, a fleet on-foot unit may attempt to disperse a riot. Any unit that does this must remain on the same ship until the end of that turn – in other words it cannot be moved again until the next turn. 

When a unit attempts to disperse a riot, roll a D6 and consult the following table. 
❌
Remember that even if a riot counter is dispersed, the station cannot operate until the start of the next turn. 

*Notes *- Aegis Marine units do not get their +2 combat bonus when attempting to remove a riot. The Hephaestus Riot Troop units get a +2 bonus to disperse attempts.

**Player Locations** 

Players are free to move around the room, moving between ship tables as they wish. [With two exceptions: 1) The map table can only be approached by captains or players in command of fighter squadrons/weapon batteries. 2) Movement is limited during Wolf Attacks, as explained in the Wolf Attack section.] 

However, where each player is located is significant. Any player at a ship's table is considered to be aboard that ship in-person within the game's world also. If for any reason you want to go to a location or talk to another player without being there in person in-game, you will have to do this in the real world by using your phone, or writing a message and passing it via Control. 

Players in Sickbay 

It is possible for some events and actions to cause a player to become Wounded. When this happens, the player must immediately go to a ship of their choice that has an undamaged Sickbay station. They must remain at the ship's table, though they may freely talk to anyone also at the table. Once phase two (team phase) of the turn in which the player arrived is over, the player may move freely again. 

Note that a player in a sickbay does not use a medical crew or take up the capacity of the station (it can still be used as normal). 

Players in the Brig 

At some point one or more players may end up being placed in the Brig of the Aegis. 

To place another player in the Brig, a player will have to justify how they wish to make it happen to Control. However, the targeted player may also be able to justify why it would not be possible if they choose to oppose it. In short – any attempts to send another player to the brig will be handled in a fairly free-form manner and based on judgements by Control. 

**If a player is in the brig:** 

They must stay at the Aegis table 
They cannot interact with the Aegis' ship panel or resources 

Communication in the Brig is limited. In addition to being stuck at the table, players can only talk to other players at the table with the permission of the Aegis' crew, and cannot phone or send messages to other players around the room. There are two exceptions to this rule. A) If there is more than one player in the Brig then they can communicate with each other freely. B) When a player first enters the brig they may choose a single other player who they must be allowed to talk to at any time during their detention. If the chosen player is not at the table, the player in the brig may contact them by phone or by using written notes passed by Control.

Players in the brig will have their game experience negatively impacted if they are left there for long. If a player remains in the brig for a full turn consisting of a full Action Phase and a full Team Phase without having a trial or being dealt with otherwise, they *may* choose to make an escape attempt. Control will adjudicate this with impacted players.
