# Rules Primer

If you only read one thing, it should be this page!

If a game component breaks a rule, the component takes precedence. If Control tells you something that contradicts the rules, Control's statement takes precedence. If you're confused, talk to Control.

## Freeform Actions

The hallmark of Megagames. If you have an idea of something you think you'd be able to do within the game universe, talk to Control about it. They will work with you to help it happen. There will be costs associated with any Freeform Action, and will likely involve collaborating with other players.

## Turn Structure

There is a timer at the front of the room and Control will make announcements when phases change.

**Action Phase** — roughly 20 minutes — You're free to move yourself around the room to talk to other players or Control, but you must be carrying a Shuttle in order to bring resources or units with you. Activate Stations on your ship using Crew and gather resources (explained on this sheet). Council members should be at the Council table within the first few minutes of this phase.

**Team Phase** — roughly 10 minutes — You should be at your ship's table checking in with your teammates and discussing your plans and what happened last turn. The News will make an announcement and afterwards you'll do a morale roll for your ship (explained on your ship mat).

## Activating Stations

Use a Crew on a Station to gain its effects. To "use" a Crew, you turn it over to its blank side. **Crew can only be Used once per turn.**

If a Station provides resources, go get them from the resource table. **You don't need a Shuttle to do this.**

## Crew vs. Units

**Crew** have a white background. Crew are used to Activate Stations. They have other uses outlined in the game components and can be used for freeform actions.

**Units** have a colored background. Units cannot Activate Stations—they are used to fight Wolf units. They also have other uses outlined in the game components and can be used for freeform actions.

## Wolf Attacks

Control will announce if a Wolf Attack happens. When you hear the announcement, you must immediately sit down at the CLOSEST ship table. Some players will be moving around during this time, you will know if you're able to move or not based on what role you're assigned to.

Refer to the Combat Cheat Sheet for instructions on how to resolve combat if needed.

## Jumps

Any ship may do a FTL jump at any time, including during combat (after the Wolves attack once). Jumps are explained on your ship mat.
