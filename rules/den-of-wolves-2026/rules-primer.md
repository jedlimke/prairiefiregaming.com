# Rules Primer

<div class="callout important" markdown="1" data-label="Important">
If you only read one thing, it should be this page!
</div>

If a game component breaks a rule, the component takes precedence. If Control tells you something that contradicts the rules, Control's statement takes precedence. If you're confused, talk to Control.

## Traitors

**There may be traitors within the fleet.**

Some players have objectives that put them at odds with the fleet's survival or the interests of their fellow players. This is a feature of the game, not a bug — and it is disclosed to you now so it doesn't come as an unpleasant surprise.

## Honor System

Resources and units are tracked on the honor system. When a station produces food, you walk to the resource table and take it — no one is checking. When you use a crew counter, you turn it face-down yourself.

That being said, **don't cheat.**

Don't move another player or ship's components without permission. Don't snoop or move stuff around that doesn't belong to you. Don't sneak extra resources, fudge die rolls, or stack the deck.

There's no winning or losing in a megagame. Cheating just makes it less interesting for everyone, including yourself.

Furthermore, if something feels suspicious, bring it to Control — not to get anyone in trouble, but to make sure it's handled fairly.

<div class="callout" markdown="1" data-label="HONOR AMONG THIEVES">
**The honor system applies to everyone — traitors included.**

A traitor is a traitor _narratively_, not _mechanically._

What a traitor *can* do is lie, deceive, and work against the fleet through legitimate in-game actions. Furthermore, any covert action a traitor wants to take should be run by Control quietly before being carried out.

## Freeform Actions & Shenanigans

The hallmark of Megagames. If you have an idea of something you think you'd be able to do within the game universe, talk to Control about it. They will work with you to help it happen. There will be costs associated with any Freeform Action, and will likely involve collaborating with other players.

## Turn Structure

There is a timer at the front of the room and Control will make announcements when phases change.

![Anatomy of a game turn](/assets/megagames/dow--rules--turn-anatomy.svg)

**Action Phase** — roughly 20 minutes — You're free to move yourself around the room to talk to other players or Control, but you must be carrying a Shuttle in order to bring resources or units with you. Activate Stations on your ship using Crew and gather resources (explained on this sheet). Council members should be at the Council table within the first few minutes of this phase.

**Team Phase** — roughly 10 minutes — You **must** return to your ship's table to check in with your teammates, discuss your plans, and review what happened last turn. The News will make an announcement and afterwards you'll do a morale roll for your ship (explained on your ship mat).

## The Fleet Needs to Trade

**No ship is self-sufficient.** Every ship in the fleet is specialized — some produce food, some water, some refine fuel, some repair damage. Your ship almost certainly makes more of something than it needs and runs short on something it can't produce at all.

**There are no fixed prices.** Resources are worth whatever both parties agree they're worth. You can give things away for free, drive a hard bargain, or anything in between. There's no rule that says you have to trade — but the fleet will fall apart if ships hoard. The game is *designed* around cooperation. A neighbor in crisis is both a political problem and an opportunity.

**If you're not sure where to start** — ask your Chief Engineer what you're producing and what you're short on. Then go talk to another ship.

## Shuttles

Shuttles are **the only way** to move Units, Crew, or resources between ships.

## Activating Stations

Use a Crew on a Station to gain its effects. To "use" a Crew, you turn it over to its blank side. **Crew can only be used once per turn.**

If a Station provides resources, go get them from the resource table. **You don't need a Shuttle to do this.**

## Crew vs. Units

**Crew** have a white background. Crew are used to Activate Stations. They have other uses outlined in the game components and can be used for freeform actions.

**Units** have a colored background. Units cannot Activate Stations — they are used to fight Wolf units. They also have other uses outlined in the game components and can be used for freeform actions.

<div class="callout" markdown="1" data-label="NOT THE SAME">
**Units are not Crew** and cannot activate stations or perform other ship-station-related actions.

**Crew are not Units** and cannot fend off boarding units or fight on foot.
</div>

When Crew are used, they're turned **face down**. Face-down Crew cannot be activated again until the next turn and cannot be transported via Shuttle to another ship.

## Wolf Attacks

Control will announce if a Wolf Attack happens. When you hear the announcement, you must immediately sit down at the **CLOSEST** ship table. Some players will be moving around during this time — you'll know if you're able to move or not based on what role you're assigned to.

**Boarding damage is unavoidable once a Boarding Squadron lands.** The only way to prevent it is to destroy the Boarding Squadron first, using Fighter Squadrons or Weapon Batteries. Your marines do not get a free first swing.

**Units placed in the Ready Room at the start of the turn** get a +1 bonus to their first roll against boarders. This is on the honor system — they must be placed there *before* a Wolf Attack is announced.

Refer to the Combat Cheat Sheet for instructions on how to resolve combat if needed.

<div class="callout info" markdown="1" data-label="BUILT DIFFERENT">
**Damaged Units** can still fight, but **damaged Crew** cannot be used until they are healed at a Sickbay or through other means.
</div>

## Jumps

Any ship may do a FTL jump at any time, including during combat (after the Wolves attack once). Jumps are explained on your ship mat.

<div class="callout important" markdown="1" data-label="JUMP INTO ACTION">
**To jump at any point during a turn, a Crew (of any type) must be placed on the Jump Drive and turned face-down at the very start of that turn — before any other action takes place.**

If no crew is committed to the Jump Drive at the start of the turn, the ship *cannot* jump that turn, even in an emergency. This catches teams off guard more often than almost any other rule. If there is any chance the fleet might jump this turn, commit the crew at the start.
