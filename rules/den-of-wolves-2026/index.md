## Your ToDo List

We've got a few things we need from you before the game on Saturday, March 7th:

1. If you haven't done so already, fill out the [pre-game casting survey ↗](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SUsCjyXTrlmdbVzFcHvWyB8tdYZuerfZqmnuvBLetHc/) ASAP so we can assign roles and get you in touch with your shipmates.
2. Read the [rules primer](rules-primer).
3. Read the [background guide](background-guide) to learn about the game universe, its history, and how you fit in.
4. If you're feeling ambitious, download the [full rules handbook ↓](/assets/megagames/dow--handbook.pdf).
5. Take a look through the [survival guide](/about/for-players/).
6. Pat yourself on the back! You're ready to play!
