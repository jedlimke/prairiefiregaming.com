# Background Guide

It is the 27th Century and thanks to Faster Than Light (FTL) technology, humanity has spread to multiple star systems. Research missions became colonies, colonies became self-sufficient societies, and before too long, these societies became powerful, independent interstellar nations in and of themselves. Many battles were fought over the centuries, but eventually humanity settled into a state of relative peace, as the Old Nations on Earth began to share more power and influence with the New Nations across the void of space.

And so it was that the Interstellar Council was formed–a government that represented the Old Nations and the New.

## The Old Nations

On Earth, the birthplace of humanity, there exist three Nations that have been in power for centuries. Long before the formation of the Council, these factions were unparalleled in power and influence, and between them they controlled the colonies that would eventually become the New Nations.

        <h4>Federated Atlantic Syndicate (FAS)</h4>
        <p>The FAS covers most of the North American and European landmasses, and has historically been a nation focused on financial power and demonstrating its own superiority wherever possible. Though its supremacy is now only a memory, they still wield considerable financial and diplomatic influence in the council. Some within the FAS hold a generations-old grudge against the Nation of Rosal, as they were the first colony to successfully win their independence several hundred years ago.</p>

        <p>The CPA covers most of the East Asian landmass, and maintains control of its massive population through a strong focus on national identity and working towards the good of the nation. Whilst they are technically old rivals of the FAS, as the centuries went on, they have found they have more and more in common with them, considering the rise of the New Nations. The CPA have long been political enemies of the Wolves–even before the current crisis–as Wolf 1061 was a mostly CPA-held system when the Wolf independence forces took control of it with little mercy shown to the pro-CPA soldiers and citizens there.</p>

## The New Nations

As the colonised planets in far off systems gained their independence, their relative disadvantages in technology and resources began to diminish as they took advantage of their room to expand and a flexibility in establishing their own political and economic systems.

        <h4>Rosal</h4>
        <p>One of the earliest planets to see large-scale colonisation, Rosal was also the first to successfully gain independence from the Old Nations, beginning with a violent war against FAS rule, before eventually signing treaties with the CPA and SAN to renounce control of their territory in exchange for certain economic and political benefits. As well as holding a mutual grudge against the FAS, Rosal is often outspoken in the Council, being unafraid to speak out against all powers–Old and New, who take actions that they do not agree with.</p>

        <p>Settlement on Proxima B started about the same time as on Rosal, though it did not gain its own independence until much later. As a large planet with heavily spread out urban centres, rebellion was difficult to get in motion. Proxima's independence came much later, with relatively little violence–primarily being a sweeping political change. The independence movement benefited from sympathetic local garrisons that saw themselves more as residents of Proxima than servants of the Old Nations they represented. This individualistic streak runs deep and can create tension with the more diplomatically minded nations.</p>

The planet of Gliese 832C was quickly recognised by early scouts as a source of many rare and valuable minerals, and even today it is one of the biggest providers of strytium ore. Gliese gained its independence through a mix of violence and industrial action, eventually gaining control of its own mining operations, and thus becoming a major influence on the Council due to its wealth in resources.</p>

        <p>The nation of Helvetii is a young one, the youngest of the New Nations in fact. They were founded after the wars of independence by apolitical refugees that had fled the conflicts. These vagabonds wandered for decades before discovering a previously unknown asteroid cluster with several planetoid-sized bodies and plentiful rare elements, which quickly gained the attention of the other nations. Their constitution swears them to neutrality and they were often called upon to act as an impartial arbiter when international negotiations reached an impasse.</p>

## The Wolves

![Wolf 1061c](/assets/megagames/dow--wolf-1061c.jpg)

The harsh terrain on **Wolf 1061c** led to a densely-packed urban population. By the time of the rebellion, the CPA had almost complete control, having pushed out all FAS and SAN forces. The Wolf rebellion was incredibly violent, with little mercy shown to CPA soldiers and civilians alike.

## The Attack

Though the Council was always fraught with heated debate and aggressive negotiation, it played its part in giving all of humanity's nations a place to debate their problems face-to-face rather than waste resources and lives in costly wars. However, the Interstellar Council still felt the need to create and maintain a military force, as pirates and small rebellions needed to be kept in check.

As such, it wasn't too great a concern when in recent decades, the nation of Wolf had become more hostile and reclusive, eventually pulling out of the Council completely. Though there was very little intelligence on what was happening on Wolf, it was generally believed that it would sort itself out internally, and the overwhelming strength of the combined Interstellar Council Service Navy would protect the Council's member nations if Wolf did anything rash.

*"The Attack", as it came to be known, took everyone by surprise.*

Announcing their intention to enact the total obliteration of all other nations, the Wolf Navy launched a combined attack on the ICSN and planetary defences across inhabited space. Advanced cyber-attacks managed to knock out automated defence protocols and cut off Command & Control networks. Carefully placed strytium-yield bombs detonated in major munition stockpiles and aboard larger military vessels, and meticulously placed sleeper agents simultaneously performed uncountable assassinations, sabotage and sending of falsified information.

The entire event was chaos. No-one knows how many lives were lost or how many vessels were destroyed, but the results were catastrophic. Major urban centres were bombarded and any surviving vessels the Wolf Navy found were destroyed without the option of surrender. Except for Wolf, the combined planets of humanity were lost.

## The Survivor Fleet

*And yet there was hope.*

The ICSS Aegis was undergoing system repairs during the attack, meaning that the cyberattacks were unable to penetrate its systems. At a repair station deep between systems, it was also safe from the majority of the Wolf Naval forces, which were focused on planets.

In the days following The Attack, a number of vessels of varying sizes found the Aegis one way or another, and eventually a fleet was formed out of ships that had survived.

An emergency government was created in the form of a new Interstellar Council. The original Council's members had been lost to The Attack, and so representatives of each nation were appointed from the survivors. The previous council's Member for Transportation inherited the title of President, being the next in succession of all known surviving Executive Council Members.

Though there were some, especially aboard the Aegis, who wanted to turn back and fight the Wolf forces, it was decided that the Survivor Fleet would instead attempt to get as far away from the Wolves as possible in order to preserve the lives of those already present.

        <p><em>Fighters</em> – Fighters are small, one-person craft typically used in close engagements between larger vessels. They are designed to be fast and highly maneuver, but in order to achieve this, they compromise on defense, leaving them very lightly armored. They are commonly equipped with light, rapid-firing weaponry for dogfighting with other Fighters, but also often have a small complement of high-power ordnance so that they can cause significant damage to larger vessels with a well-aimed strike.</p>

        <p>The Javelin is one of the newest generation of missile boats commissioned and built for the ICS. It was on a shakedown trip when The Attack happened, and its crew is green but eager for payback against The Wolves. Its guided anti-ship missiles are powerful but costly to produce, and as prototypes, can be unpredictable. It also has cannon batteries and a shuttle. As a smaller vessel, The Javelin is reliant on resupply for its crew's needs; there are no onboard food or water synthesizers.</p>

        <p>The Dione is a huge luxury cruiser designed for long-term recreation. In the Survivor fleet it has been repurposed as the home of the new Interstellar Council, as well as housing the vast majority of the fleet's previously FAS-resident civilians. The Dione still has high-end luxury facilities on board, as well as a small complement of fighter squadrons for personal security.</p>

        <p>The Icebreaker is a large mining vessel, providing an essential function for the Fleet by harvesting important materials and strytium ore from nearby asteroids. The mining drones are very effective but require a lot of manpower to maintain and operate.

        <p>The Lucas is a SAN-built vessel designed to re-supply research stations with water in the event of unforeseen issues or emergencies. In the Survivor fleet it provides a great deal of the Fleet's much needed water supplies, as well of being a place of technical prowess, with some excellent engineering minds on board. The Lucas is mostly populated by the Fleet's SAN resident civilians.</p>

        <p>The Hephaestus is a Helvetii vessel of questionable origin and age. Some say it was originally a retired ICS heavy cruiser, other sources claim it was built by the CPA as a prospecting vessel. Regardless, it's changed hands and been modified so many times now that its designers would not recognize it. Its makeshift repair facilities, high tech prospecting lasers, and slapdash refinery unit make it as close to a jack-of-all-trades industrial vessel as there is in the fleet.</p>
