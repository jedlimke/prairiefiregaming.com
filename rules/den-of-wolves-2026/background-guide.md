# Background Guide

It is the 27th Century and thanks to Faster Than Light (FTL) technology, humanity has spread to multiple star systems. Research missions became colonies, colonies became self-sufficient societies, and before too long, these societies became powerful, independent interstellar nations in and of themselves. Many battles were fought over the centuries. Most scars healed with time—though not all—and eventually humanity settled into a state of relative peace, as the Old Nations on Earth began to share more power and influence with the New Nations across the void of space.

And so it was that the Interstellar Council was formed—a government that represented the Old Nations and the New.

_Not every world fell peacefully into that order, however._

![Wolf 1061c](/assets/megagames/dow--wolf-1061c.jpg)

The harsh terrain on **Wolf 1061c** had always bred a densely-packed, tightly-knit urban population. What became known as the _Wolf War of Independence_— or **WWI**, to those who lived through it—began when the Wolves rose up against the CPA, who held dominant control of the system. The fighting was brutal from the start, with little mercy shown to CPA soldiers and civilians alike. What started as a regional conflict quickly drew in every interstellar nation. Though every nation sent forces, the CPA bore the brunt of the fighting—a wound that has never fully healed.

After years of brutal conflict, an armistice was signed. Wolf 1061c was recognized as sovereign territory, but the Wolves refused a seat at the Interstellar Council and severed all contact with humanity.

For the next fifty years, they heard _nothing_ from the Wolves.

_Absolutely nothing._

## The Interim

Though the Council was always fraught with heated debate and aggressive negotiation, it played its part in giving all of humanity's nations a place to debate their problems face-to-face rather than waste resources and lives in costly wars. However, the Interstellar Council still felt the need to create and maintain a military force, as pirates and small rebellions needed to be kept in check.

As such, the fifty-year silence from the Wolves had long since faded into background noise—an old scar that most had made their peace with. There was very little intelligence on what was happening on Wolf 1061, so it was generally assumed that the armistice would simply hold. The overwhelming strength of the combined _Interstellar Council Service Navy_ was more than enough to handle any trouble if it didn't.

_They believed they could handle any threat._

## The Attack

Without warning, the Wolf Navy launched a combined attack on the ICSN and planetary defenses across inhabited space. Advanced cyber-attacks managed to knock out automated defense protocols and cut off command & control networks. Carefully placed strytium-yield bombs detonated in major munition stockpiles and aboard larger military vessels, and meticulously placed sleeper agents simultaneously performed uncountable assassinations, sabotage and sending of falsified information.

The entire event was chaos. No-one knows how many lives were lost or how many vessels were destroyed, but the results were catastrophic. Major urban centers were bombarded and any surviving vessels the Wolf Navy found were destroyed without the option of surrender. 

_The combined planets of humanity were lost..._

## The Survivor Fleet

_...and yet there was hope._

The _ICSS Aegis_ was undergoing system repairs during the Attack, meaning that the cyberattacks were unable to penetrate its systems. At a repair station deep between systems, it was also safe from the majority of the Wolf Naval forces, which were focused on planetary bombardment and widescale destruction.

In the days following the Attack, a number of vessels of varying sizes found the _Aegis_ one way or another, and eventually a fleet was formed out of ships that had survived.

An emergency government was created in the form of a new Interstellar Council. The original Council's members had been lost to the Attack, and so representatives of each nation were appointed from the survivors. The previous council's Minister of Transportation inherited the title of President, being the next in succession of all known surviving Interstellar Council Members.

Though there were some, especially aboard the _Aegis_, who wanted to turn back and fight the Wolf forces, it was decided that the _Survivor Fleet_ would instead attempt to get as far away from the Wolves as possible in order to preserve the lives of those already present.

### The Old Nations

The Old Nations of Earth were once the unrivaled centers of power—the governments that built the first ships, funded the first colonies, and fought the first wars of independence. Their cities are gone. Their infrastructure is ash. What remains of them is here, aboard a handful of ships, navigating a new political reality in the Council chambers of the _Dione_.

      <div class="fleet-content">
        <h4>Federated Atlantic Syndicate (FAS)</h4>
        <p>The FAS long defined itself by financial power and a relentless need to demonstrate its own superiority. Whatever financial infrastructure backed that power is now ash. But the FAS's talent for diplomacy and political maneuvering—honed over centuries—translates readily to the new Council chambers aboard the <em>Dione</em>, which is itself a former FAS vessel now repurposed as the seat of government. Old habits die hard, and old grudges die harder: the FAS resentment toward Rosal, the first colony to break free, hasn't faded just because the world has ended.</p>

        <h4>Confederated Peoples of Asia (CPA)</h4>
        <p>The CPA was the government of most of the East Asian landmass, built on a strong emphasis on national identity and collective purpose. Long rivals of the FAS, the centuries had pulled the two into an uneasy alignment as the New Nations rose. But the CPA's defining wound predates all of that: Wolf 1061 was a mostly CPA-held system when the Wolf War of Independence broke out—and the Wolves showed little mercy to her soldiers and citizens there. Though WWI eventually drew in every nation, the CPA paid the steepest price... and the Attack has ripped that old scar wide open. For the CPA survivors now aboard the <em>Icebreaker</em> and <em>Fuerza Leon</em>, grief and fury are never far from the surface.</p>

        <h4>South American Nations (SAN)</h4>
        <p>The historic nations of Central and South America combined to form the SAN, and were long-standing political allies of the CPA, bound together by a common wariness of the FAS. As the New Nations rose, that old solidarity faded, and the SAN found itself more focused on simply having a voice among louder, more powerful neighbors. In the Survivor Fleet, SAN civilians are concentrated aboard the <em>Lucas</em> and the <em>Salvador</em>—a water-supply vessel and a hospital ship. Quieter than the others in the old politics, the SAN now finds its people doing some of the most essential work in the fleet.</p>

### The New Nations

The independent worlds that broke from Old Earth over the past centuries each bring their own character, history, and capabilities to the Survivor Fleet. Their old advantages—room to expand, flexible economies, distance from Earth's politics—are gone. What remains is who they are.

        <h4>Rosal</h4>
        <p>One of the earliest planets to be colonized, Rosal was also the first to win independence—through a violent war against FAS rule, followed by treaties with the CPA and SAN that formalized their sovereignty in exchange for economic concessions. They've never let anyone forget it. Rosal is loud in the Council, unafraid to challenge Old or New Nations alike when they believe a wrong is being done. In the Survivor Fleet, Rosal's civilians are concentrated aboard the <em>Shepherd</em> and the <em>Endeavour</em>. That independent streak—the one that started a war of liberation centuries ago—is still very much alive.</p>

        <h4>Proxima</h4>
        <p>Settlement on Proxima B began around the same time as Rosal, but independence came much later and with far less bloodshed—primarily a sweeping political change driven by garrison forces who saw themselves as Proximans first. That individualistic streak runs deep and has always created friction with more diplomatically minded nations. In the Survivor Fleet, Proxima's people are aboard the <em>Quellon</em> and the <em>Vulcan</em>—the latter a prison transport whose arrival caused no shortage of controversy. Proxima's self-reliance can be an asset in a crisis. Whether it translates to cooperation is another question.</p>

        <h4>Gliese</h4>
        <p>Gliese's history has always been defined by what lies beneath its surface. The planet of Gliese 832C was quickly recognized by early scouts as a rich source of rare minerals, and it became one of the largest providers of strytium ore in known space. Independence came through a combination of violence and industrial action—Gliese didn't just fight for sovereignty, it fought for control of its own mines. In the Survivor Fleet, that expertise is existential: <em>Refinery 124</em>, crewed by Gliese workers, is the fleet's primary source of the strytium fuel that keeps it ahead of the Wolf Navy. Without Gliese, the fleet stops moving.</p>

        <p>The youngest of the New Nations, Helvetii was founded not through rebellion but through wandering—apolitical refugees from the wars of independence who drifted for decades before discovering an uncharted asteroid cluster rich in rare elements. Their constitution is built around neutrality, and they were regularly called upon to mediate when Council negotiations reached an impasse. In the Survivor Fleet, Helvetii's people crew the <em>Hephaestus</em> and the <em>Baltar</em>. Their neutrality is now the most complicated position in the fleet: when everything and everyone has been attacked, what does it mean to take no side?</p>

        <p>The <em>Star Alpha</em> is the name given to the vessel transporting the President of the Council–in the Survivor Fleet, this is also functionally the President's permanent residence. This is a repurposed luxury vessel, and very small compared to the other vessels in the Fleet.</p>
      </div>

        <h4>ICSS Aegis <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--isc.png" alt="Interstellar Council" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 6</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Aegis</em> is a medium-sized military vessel, functioning as both battleship and carrier. As well as having some weapon batteries, it carries a healthy complement of both fighter squadrons and marines.</p>
        <p><strong>Fighters</strong> – Fighters are small, one-person craft typically used in close engagements between larger vessels. They are designed to be fast and highly maneuver, but in order to achieve this, they compromise on defense, leaving them very lightly armored. They are commonly equipped with light, rapid-firing weaponry for dogfighting with other Fighters, but also often have a small complement of high-power ordnance so that they can cause significant damage to larger vessels with a well-aimed strike.</p>
      </div>

        <h4>ICSS Javelin <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--isc.png" alt="Interstellar Council" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 4</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Javelin</em> is one of the newest generation of missile boats commissioned and built for the ICS. It was on a shakedown trip when the Attack happened, and its crew is green but eager for payback against the Wolves. Its guided anti-ship missiles are powerful but costly to produce, and as prototypes, can be unpredictable. It also has cannon batteries and a shuttle. As a smaller vessel, the <em>Javelin</em> is reliant on resupply for its crew's needs; there are no onboard food or water synthesizers.</p>
      </div>

        <h4>The Dione <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--fas.png" alt="FAS" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 4</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Dione</em> is a huge luxury cruiser designed for long-term recreation. In the Survivor fleet it has been repurposed as the home of the new Interstellar Council, as well as housing the vast majority of the fleet's previously FAS-resident civilians. The Dione still has high-end luxury facilities on board, as well as a small complement of fighter squadrons for personal security.</p>
      </div>

        <h4>The Icebreaker <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--cpa.png" alt="CPA" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 4</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Icebreaker</em> is a large mining vessel, providing an essential function for the Fleet by harvesting important materials and strytium ore from nearby asteroids. The mining drones are very effective but require a lot of manpower to maintain and operate. Having originated in a CPA orbital shipyard, the <em>Icebreaker</em> is mostly populated by the Fleet's CPA-resident civilians. Like the <em>Dione</em>, it also has a small complement of fighter squadrons for security.</p>
      </div>

        <h4>The Fuerza Leon <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--cpa.png" alt="CPA" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 2</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Fuerza Leon</em> ("Lion Force" in a long-dead language) is a bulk hauler under the CPA flag, designed for deep space cargo transport. It has several immense cargo bays that could be put to use for any number of purposes, and has several highly skilled specialists who were traveling along with the crew en route to their destination on Rosal when the Attack happened.</p>

        <h4>The Lucas <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--san.png" alt="SAN" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 4</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Lucas</em> is a SAN-built vessel designed to re-supply research stations with water in the event of unforeseen issues or emergencies. In the Survivor Fleet it provides a great deal of the Fleet's much needed water supplies, as well as being a place of technical prowess, with some excellent engineering minds on board. The <em>Lucas</em> is mostly populated by the Fleet's SAN resident civilians.</p>
      </div>

        <h4>The Salvador <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--san.png" alt="SAN" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 2</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Salvador</em> is a small, SAN-built hospital ship that provides important medical services to the Survivor Fleet. The Chief Surgeon is the only actual medical doctor remaining in the fleet, although there are a number of specialists trained in first aid and numerous nurses to help.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="fleet-vessel">
      <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--ship--shepherd.png" alt="The Shepherd" class="ship--shepherd">

        <h4>The Shepherd <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--rosal.png" alt="Rosal" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 4</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Shepherd</em> is a very large food production vessel, designed to grow food in deep space or orbit for various interstellar missions or surface-based emergencies. In the Survivor Fleet it provides most of the Fleet's food supplies. The <em>Shepherd</em> is also where most of the Fleet's Rosal-resident civilians now live.</p>
      </div>

        <p>The <em>Endeavour</em> is a small, Rosal-built research vessel. In the Survivor Fleet, it puts its crew's academic skills to use to try and develop improvements and upgrades for the various vessels in the fleet.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="fleet-vessel">
      <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--ship--quellon.png" alt="The Quellon" class="ship--quellon">

        <p>The <em>Quellon</em> is a general purpose operations vessel designed to provide support for missions or emergencies for Proxima. It has facilities for producing large quantities of water, as well as its own fighter squadron complement.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="fleet-vessel">
      <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--ship--vulcan.png" alt="The Vulcan" class="ship--vulcan">

        <h4>The Vulcan <img src="/assets/megagames/dow--nation--proxima.png" alt="Proxima" class="inline-flag"> <small>Crew of 2</small></h4>
        <p>The <em>Vulcan</em> is a long-distance transport for prisoners, originally traveling from Proxima. Though it originally caused some contention when it joined the Survivor Fleet, it eventually proved its worth, thanks to it being the only vessel other than the <em>Aegis</em> to have weapons batteries, as well as being able to provide a wealth of additional labor.</p>
      </div>

        <p>One of Gliese's many refinery vessels, <em>Refinery 124</em> has taken on many Gliese civilians, but a great deal of its crew are still workers in the refinery stations—working hard to provide the Survivor Fleet with the strytium fuel it needs to stay ahead of the Wolf Navy.</p>

        <p>The <em>Hephaestus</em> is a Helvetii vessel of questionable origin and age. Some say it was originally a retired ICS heavy cruiser, other sources claim it was built by the CPA as a prospecting vessel. Regardless, it's changed hands and been modified so many times now that its designers would not recognize it. Its makeshift repair facilities, high tech prospecting lasers, and slapdash refinery unit make it as close to a jack-of-all-trades industrial vessel as there is in the fleet.</p>

        <p>The <em>Baltar</em> is a cutting edge research vessel commissioned, designed, and built for the recently established Helvetii navy. Its focus is on long range observation and scanning, with the intent of finding remote asteroids and other celestial bodies for Helvetii ships to exploit. It also contains general research labs specializing in the physical and material sciences, as befits a nation focused on industrial and economic dominance.</p>
