roles:

  # ─── ICSS AEGIS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The fleet's only battleship. Loyal to the Council; the shield that keeps
  # humanity alive.

  - name: Admiral
    team: Aegis
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the ICSS Aegis - the fleet's sole battleship and the backbone
      of its military power. Your job is high-level: strategic decisions, key
      diplomacy, and close liaison with the President. You control the ship's
      shield projector and weapon batteries when they're needed. During Wolf
      attacks you must be at the Fleet Map directing the Aegis' systems.
      You serve the Council, but if a crisis demands immediate action before
      orders arrive, act - then answer for it afterward.

  - name: XO
    team: Aegis
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Aegis. You have direct control of the ship's
      Marine squads and are functionally captain whenever the Admiral is away
      (which is often). During Wolf attacks you coordinate Marine deployment
      to other ships that need boots on the ground. If both the Admiral and
      XO are off the Aegis, Comms takes command.

  - name: FWCO
    team: Aegis
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Fighter Wing Commander/Officer - you control the Aegis' nine fighter
      squadrons. You manage pilot assignments, positioning, and maintenance
      between engagements, and you personally direct the fighters during Wolf
      attacks at the Fleet Map. The Aegis' air superiority lives or dies by
      how well you manage those squadrons.

  - name: Comms Officer
    team: Aegis
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are the Aegis' ears and voice across the fleet - gathering
      intelligence for the Admiral and pushing critical information out to
      other ships. You are third-in-command if the Admiral and XO are both
      away. Stay mobile, stay informed, and make sure the right people always
      know what they need to know.

  - name: Logs Officer
    team: Aegis
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Logistics Officer - responsible for keeping the Aegis stocked with food,
      water, fuel, and materials. You also oversee the ship's transport
      shuttles (though you can delegate that). You can play a wider role by
      helping other fleet vessels secure critical resources. Nothing moves
      without you making it possible.

  - name: Council Liaison
    team: Aegis
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are the Admiral's authorized voice in the Interstellar Council
      chambers - you may speak but cannot vote. Your job is a two-way street:
      represent Aegis interests in political discussions, and keep the crew
      briefed on everything happening in the civilian government. You are the
      bridge between the military and the politicians.

  # ─── STAR ALPHA ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The Presidential vessel. A small repurposed luxury ship that is the seat
  # of Executive power - and the last real government humanity has.

  - name: President
    team: Star Alpha
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are humanity's head of state - the last in line of succession after
      the Attack. You lead the Interstellar Council, sign laws passed by it,
      and serve as Commander in Chief of the military (meaning the Admiral
      answers to you). Your political roots are in the FAS, but the law
      demands neutrality - and the fleet is watching. Keep the government
      strong, keep the Admiral in line, and keep the fleet together.

  - name: Vice President
    team: Star Alpha
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      The President's eyes and ears across the fleet. Your job is to get out
      of the Star Alpha and into the room - talking to ships, taking the
      temperature of the nations, staying tight with the Admiral. You cast
      the tie-breaking vote whenever the Council is deadlocked. If something
      goes wrong with the President, you're next.

  - name: Chief of Staff
    team: Star Alpha
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You run the Star Alpha's day-to-day operations: food, water, fuel,
      materials, and security. You also support the President and VP on law
      enforcement matters when needed. The administrative engine of the
      Presidency runs through you - if politics is the face, you are the
      spine.

  - name: Parliamentarian
    team: Star Alpha
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You draft the language of proposed laws and bring them before the
      Council to vote on. You are yourself a voting member of the Council.
      In a fleet with no surviving legal infrastructure, the precision of
      what gets written matters enormously. You are the architect of
      whatever new laws this remnant of humanity will live by.

  # ─── THE DIONE (FAS) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Luxury cruiser repurposed as home to 10,000 FAS civilians and the
  # Interstellar Council itself. The political heart of the fleet.

  - name: Captain
    team: Dione
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the largest civilian vessel in the fleet and the home of
      the Interstellar Council. The Dione carries ~10,000 FAS citizens and
      produces almost nothing - your ship needs the rest of the fleet to
      survive, and you'd better make sure they know it. Protect FAS
      prestige, protect the Council's home on your ship, and do not let
      Rosal undermine you.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Dione
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Dione. You take the helm when the Captain is
      away. During Wolf attacks you must report to the Fleet Map to direct
      the Dione's two fighter squadrons. Keep the ship running and the
      civilians calm.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Dione
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You keep the Dione's considerable systems running. A ship of this size
      and civilian population demands constant attention. Coordinate with
      other engineers in the fleet to share knowledge and fill gaps in
      repair capacity.

  - name: Council Member
    team: Dione
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      FAS representative on the Interstellar Council. You vote on all
      legislation. Defend Old Nation interests, keep Rosal in check, and
      maintain the coalition with the CPA and SAN. The Council is physically
      on your ship - use that home-field advantage. Oppose any move to
      relocate it.

  # ─── THE SHEPHERD (ROSAL) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The fleet's primary food production vessel. Rosal's independent spirit
  # is as important as the calories it grows.

  - name: Captain
    team: Shepherd
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the ship that feeds the fleet. Without the Shepherd's food
      production, people starve - and you know it. Use that leverage firmly
      but wisely. You represent Rosal's proud tradition of self-determination
      and standing up to Old Nation dominance. Keep the food flowing and
      Rosal relevant.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Shepherd
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Shepherd. Keep ship operations running
      smoothly when the Captain is in Council or off-ship. Support food
      production and security, and reinforce Rosal's values in every
      interaction.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Shepherd
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You maintain the Shepherd's food production systems - the biological
      and mechanical infrastructure that literally keeps the fleet fed.
      Breakdowns here are fleet emergencies. Coordinate with other engineers
      for parts and upgrades.

  - name: Council Member
    team: Shepherd
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Rosal representative on the Interstellar Council. You vote on
      legislation and advocate loudly for New Nation rights. You may spend
      the Team Phase at either the Shepherd or the Endeavour. Push back
      against Old Nation power, keep the FAS honest, and build coalition
      with Gliese and Helvetii.

  # ─── THE LUCAS (SAN) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Primary water supply vessel and home to SAN engineering expertise.

  - name: Captain
    team: Lucas
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the fleet's main water supplier. The Lucas' distillation
      units provide most of the fleet's fresh water - an existential
      resource. Protect the ship and shuttle at all costs. SAN's reputation
      as an engineering and technical powerhouse lives on here; use it.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Lucas
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Lucas. Keep operations tight when the Captain
      is away. Help manage water distribution negotiations and support the
      engineering training programs the SAN faculty are running.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Lucas
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You maintain the water distillation systems and the SAN university
      faculty aboard. The Lucas has the remnants of SAN's Engineering
      University - you are uniquely placed to train engineers fleet-wide.
      That capability makes you one of the most strategically important
      engineers in the entire fleet.

  - name: Council Member
    team: Lucas
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      SAN representative on the Interstellar Council. You vote on
      legislation. You may spend the Team Phase at the Lucas or the Salvador.
      Maintain Old Nation alliances (especially with the CPA), figure out
      why the CPA has gone so quiet lately, and make sure the fleet knows
      water comes from you.

  # ─── THE ICEBREAKER (CPA) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Large CPA mining vessel - the fleet's main source of materials and ore.
  # Crewed by survivors with raw grief and a vendetta against the Wolves.

  - name: Captain
    team: Icebreaker
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the fleet's primary mining ship - the main source of
      materials and strytium ore. The CPA lost more than anyone in the
      Attack; your people's grief is real and sharp. Maintain production,
      protect the fleet's industrial backbone, and make sure no one forgets
      what the Wolves did.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Icebreaker
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Icebreaker. Take command when the Captain
      is off-ship. During Wolf attacks, report to the Fleet Map to direct
      the Icebreaker's fighter squadrons. Keep the mining drones operational
      and the civilian population stable.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Icebreaker
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You maintain the Icebreaker's mining drones and industrial systems.
      The drone arrays are effective but labor-intensive - uptime is
      everything. Work with the fleet's other engineers to solve problems
      quickly, and keep ore flowing to the refineries.

  - name: Council Member
    team: Icebreaker
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      CPA representative on the Interstellar Council. You vote on
      legislation. Defend Old Nation alliances and make sure the fleet never
      becomes sympathetic to the Wolves. Push for surveillance and proactive
      anti-Wolf measures. The CPA paid the highest price in the Attack -
      make sure that sacrifice carries political weight.

  # ─── REFINERY 124 (GLIESE) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The fleet's fuel source. Without strytium, the fleet stops running.

  - name: Captain
    team: Refinery 124
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the ship that keeps the fleet moving. Refinery 124
      processes strytium ore into the fuel every vessel needs to survive.
      Gliese's strength has always been quiet, industrial, essential - you
      embody that. Use your resource leverage as soft power in the Council
      and ensure workers' rights are never an afterthought.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Refinery 124
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of Refinery 124. Keep the refinery running when the
      Captain is in negotiations or away. Support the crew, protect the
      production schedule, and represent Gliese's no-nonsense work ethic.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Refinery 124
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are responsible for the refinery operations themselves - the
      processing of ore into usable strytium fuel. This is the most
      technically demanding job on the ship. Downtime here is a fleet
      emergency. Coordinate with Icebreaker and Hephaestus on ore supply.

  - name: Council Member
    team: Refinery 124
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Gliese representative on the Interstellar Council. You vote on
      legislation. Gliese prefers soft power to loud rhetoric - let the fuel
      tap speak. Ally with Rosal on New Nation issues, advocate for workers'
      rights and efficient resource policy, and call out inefficiency
      wherever you find it.

  # ─── THE QUELLON (PROXIMA) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Proxima's operations vessel - water supply, fighter squadrons,
  # and fierce self-reliance.

  - name: Captain
    team: Quellon
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command Proxima's primary vessel - a significant water producer
      and fighter carrier. Proxima's identity is self-sufficiency; live it.
      Protect Proximan interests, keep your fighters ready, and never let
      anyone tell you Proxima needs to depend on others to survive.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Quellon
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Quellon. Take command when the Captain is
      away. During Wolf attacks, report to the Fleet Map to control the
      Quellon's fighters. Keep water production and ship security running
      smoothly.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Quellon
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You maintain the Quellon's water production systems and ship
      engineering. Proxima prides itself on not needing hand-outs; your
      job is to make sure the Quellon never has to ask for one.

  - name: Council Member
    team: Quellon
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Proxima representative on the Interstellar Council. You vote on
      legislation. You may spend the Team Phase at the Quellon or the Vulcan.
      Advocate hard for Proximan self-sufficiency and redundancy fleet-wide.
      Push back against Old Nation dominance. Keep close ties with the Vulcan
      crew.

  # ─── THE ENDEAVOR (ROSAL) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # A small research vessel - home to most of humanity's remaining scientists,
  # one golden retriever, and one chimpanzee.

  - name: Captain
    team: Endeavor
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the most scientifically important ship in the fleet. The
      Endeavor carries the majority of humanity's surviving scientists - if
      something can be figured out, it gets figured out here. Protect your
      crew, manage the politics between Rosal idealism and scientific
      pragmatism, and make sure the scientists stay focused on keeping
      the fleet alive.

  - name: Chief Scientist
    team: Endeavor
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You lead humanity's last surviving research faculty. Your team develops
      upgrades and technical solutions for all fleet vessels. Science
      projects can be proposed to Control freely - be creative. Reach out to
      the Baltar for collaboration. Watch for religious or political
      interference with scientific progress, and remember that the fleet
      survives on human ingenuity.

  # ─── THE SALVADOR (SAN) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The fleet's only hospital ship.

  - name: Captain
    team: Salvador
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the only dedicated medical vessel in the fleet. The
      Salvador is small but indispensable. Your job is to make sure medical
      services run, your crew is supported, and the SAN's voice is heard
      through the Lucas Council member. Keep close ties with the Lucas, and
      do not let anyone overlook the Salvador's role in keeping people alive.

  - name: Head Surgeon
    team: Salvador
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are the most experienced doctor alive. Treat the wounded, train
      more doctors, and advocate for medical staffing across the fleet.
      You have some creative pharmaceutical ideas worth exploring - the
      Endeavor's scientists may be useful partners. You are also concerned
      about the health and welfare of the prisoners on the Vulcan.

  # ─── THE VULCAN (PROXIMA) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # A prison transport that earned its place in the fleet through firepower
  # and labor.

  - name: Captain
    team: Vulcan
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the only non-Aegis vessel with weapon batteries. The
      Vulcan carries ~413 prisoners and 45 Proximan guards, and its arrival
      in the fleet was controversial. Prove its worth. During Wolf attacks
      you must be at the Fleet Map directing the weapon batteries. Keep
      Proximan vessels prioritized for defense.

  - name: Warden
    team: Vulcan
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You manage the prison population - a source of labor the fleet needs
      but the fleet doesn't fully trust. Keep the prisoners productive, keep
      them under control, and resist the Salvador's insinuations that your
      crew mistreats them. Your labor pool and the Vulcan's weapons are
      Proxima's biggest contributions to fleet survival.

  # ─── PRESS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The fleet's news media - information brokers, morale shapers, and the
  # closest thing to accountability this remnant of humanity has.

  - name: Editor
    team: Press
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You lead the news media team - the only organization in the fleet with
      unrestricted freedom of movement. Oversee editorial direction, manage
      the broadcast schedule (one report per game turn, ~4 minutes), and
      allocate your reporters strategically. Your team shapes morale across
      the fleet: positive coverage helps ships, negative coverage hurts.
      Broadcast power is real power - use it seriously, not sensationally.

  - name: Ace Reporter
    team: Press
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You chase the big story. You have the instincts and source network to
      get information others can't. Cultivate relationships with key
      players, break the most important stories of the game, and always
      know more than you let on. You have freedom of movement - use it to
      be in the right room at the right moment.

  - name: Fleet Correspondent
    team: Press
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You cover the fleet's day-to-day pulse - ship operations, civilian
      conditions, inter-vessel relationships. You are the generalist on the
      team, circulating widely and building relationships across all ships.
      Look for the human stories that shape morale.

  - name: Military Correspondent
    team: Press
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You cover the military side of the fleet - the Aegis, the Javelin,
      the Vulcan, and tactical events during Wolf attacks. Build trust with
      the Admiral and military leadership to get access, while retaining
      editorial independence. Report on battles, readiness, and the human
      cost of the war.

  - name: Political Correspondent
    team: Press
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You cover the Council, the Presidency, and the political maneuvering
      between nations. You are allowed to observe Council proceedings - a
      rare privilege. Track legislation, alliances, vote tallies, and the
      gap between what politicians say publicly and what they do privately.

  # ─── SOLO ROLES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  - name: Arborist
    team: Solo Roles
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are the Prophet of the Universal Arbour - a rapidly growing new
      religion built on the belief that the Universe is a sentient, knowing
      entity that speaks to you personally through visions. Weeks ago you
      had dozens of followers. Now you have hundreds, and growing. You roam
      the entire fleet freely. Gain followers, gain political influence, and
      decide what kind of prophet you want to be: shepherd, demagogue, or
      revolutionary. This role is freeform and roleplay-heavy.

  - name: Inquisitor
    team: Solo Roles
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are the last Inquisitor General in the fleet - Proxima's surviving
      judicial authority, and the only judicial authority of any kind. You
      are judge, jury, and prosecutor. Your power is technically unlimited
      but practically tenuous: the Council can curtail you if you go too far.
      Investigate traitors, root out Wolf agents, and keep an independent
      judiciary alive. You start aboard the Star Alpha and can move freely.

  - name: Firebrand
    team: Solo Roles
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You are a Gliese political prisoner - populist, charismatic, and just
      released after a decade of imprisonment for anti-FAS activism. A
      stencil of your face is a symbol of resistance across what's left of
      human space. You were on the Vulcan when the Attack happened, your
      sentence was illegally extended, and you're now being held on the
      Aegis. Once free, your voice could reshape the fleet's politics.
      You have strong support among workers and prisoners. Use it - or
      decide what it means that you have it.

  # ─── THE HEPHAESTUS (HELVETII) ────────────────────────────────────────────
  # A patchwork industrial vessel crewed entirely by pardoned former criminals
  # on a Helvetii rehabilitation program.

  - name: Captain
    team: Hephaestus
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command a jury-rigged industrial jack-of-all-trades crewed by
      reformed criminals newly arrived in the Helvetii rehabilitation
      program. They're rowdy but capable. Your ship has prospecting lasers,
      a makeshift refinery, and repair facilities - plus Riot Police for
      when the crew gets out of hand. Maintain neutrality, push for free
      trade, and prove Helvetii belongs at the table.

  - name: First Officer
    team: Hephaestus
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Hephaestus. Your job is managing both the
      ship's operations and its challenging workforce. Help the Captain
      keep order, keep the industrial systems running, and ensure the Riot
      Police are deployed only when necessary.

  - name: Chief Engineer
    team: Hephaestus
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You maintain the Hephaestus' patchwork systems - a ship so heavily
      modified its original designers wouldn't recognize it. You have also
      cracked how to alloy scrap metal into military-grade armor plating.
      Use this to help protect fleet vessels from Wolf attack damage. An
      ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

  - name: Diplomat (Council Member)
    team: Hephaestus
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Helvetii representative in the Interstellar Council - junior member
      status, which means you may speak but cannot vote (yet). You may
      spend the Team Phase at either Helvetii vessel. Push for full Council
      membership, advocate for free trade and neutral arbitration, and
      consider whether the role of Parliamentarian might one day be yours.

  # ─── THE BALTAR (HELVETII) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # A cutting-edge Helvetii research vessel with a multinational science crew.

  - name: Captain
    team: Baltar
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command Helvetii's state-of-the-art research ship, purpose-built
      for long-range scanning and resource prospecting. Your crew is
      multinational and doesn't feel tightly bound to Helvetii neutrality.
      Find asteroids, find resources, find opportunities - and forge your
      own political identity distinct from the Hephaestus' orthodoxy.

  - name: Chief Scientist
    team: Baltar
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You lead a multinational science team in physical and material
      sciences, long-range observation, and resource prospecting. Reach
      out to the Endeavor - your research overlaps with theirs in important
      ways, and collaboration could benefit the whole fleet. Your team's
      independence from Helvetii neutrality is a feature, not a bug.

  # ─── ICSS JAVELIN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The fleet's newest missile boat - green crew, prototype weapons, and a
  # burning desire to hit back.

  - name: Captain
    team: Javelin
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      You command the ICS' newest missile boat - still on its shakedown
      cruise when the Attack happened. Your crew is green but furious. You
      watched Old Earth burn from Jupiter orbit. Your anti-ship missiles are
      prototype weapons: powerful, accurate, and expensive. During Wolf
      attacks you must be at the Fleet Map directing weapons and missiles.
      You answer to the Admiral, but if there's a shot at the Wolf war
      machine, you take it.

  - name: XO
    team: Javelin
    logo-path: ""
    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Javelin and direct commander of its Marine
      squads. When the Captain is directing weapons at the Fleet Map, you
      coordinate Marine defense against boarders. You must also report to
      the Fleet Map during Wolf attacks to co-direct the Javelin's systems.
      ICS Marines get +2 in combat - keep them sharp.

      You maintain the Javelin's systems, including the prototype missile
      launchers - which are finicky and temperamental. No onboard food or
      water synthesizers means resupply is constant. Keep the ship battle-
      ready and make sure the missiles are operational when they're needed.

      The ICS Marines might take orders from the XO, but they listen to you.
      You are battle-hardened and your soldiers know it. You have special
      combat abilities that give you an edge in a fight. Keep your people
      alive, follow the XO's tactical orders, and remember that ICS Marines
      get +2 in all combat against on-foot units.

    brief: |
      You command a CPA bulk hauler whose cargo was partially jettisoned
      during emergency jumps. The remaining cargo is disorganized, the
      manifest is scrambled, and several highly skilled CPA specialists are
      aboard as passengers. Those specialists are your biggest asset - work
      with your Council member to use them as bargaining chips. Your empty
      bays could be converted into anything the fleet needs.

    brief: |
      Second-in-command of the Fuerza Leon. With a minimal permanent crew
      and a roster of specialist passengers, your job is keeping everyone
      organized and the ship operational. Help the Captain navigate CPA
      politics and figure out what to do with those cargo bays.
