# About Prairie Fire Gaming

Prairie Fire Gaming creates and hosts immersive megagame experiences in the Midwest.

## What We Do

We bring people together for large-scale, collaborative gaming experiences that blend strategy, roleplay, and social interaction. Our megagames are day-long events where dozens of players take on unique roles, working together and competing to shape the outcome of epic scenarios.

## Our Approach

Whether you're playing as a head of state, a military commander, a scientist, a journalist, or even an alien invader, every role in our megagames is crucial to the experience. We design our events to be:

- **Inclusive**: No experience necessary—we welcome both veteran gamers and newcomers
- **Engaging**: Multiple gameplay styles ensure there's something for everyone
- **Memorable**: These aren't just games; they're shared stories you'll talk about for years
