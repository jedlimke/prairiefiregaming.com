# About

Prairie Fire Gaming creates and hosts immersive megagame experiences in the Midwest.

## What We Do

We bring people together for large-scale, collaborative gaming experiences that blend strategy, roleplay, and social interaction. Our megagames are day-long events where dozens of players take on unique roles, working together and competing to shape the outcome of epic scenarios.

## Our Approach

Whether you're playing as a head of state, a military commander, a scientist, a journalist, or even an alien invader, every role in our megagames is crucial to the experience. We design our events to be:

- **Inclusive**: No experience necessary—we welcome both veteran gamers and newcomers
- **Engaging**: Multiple gameplay styles ensure there's something for everyone
- **Memorable**: These aren't just games; they're shared stories you'll talk about for years

## Our History

Prairie Fire Gaming has been creating memorable megagame experiences since 2017:

**Watch the Skies: Fargo** (December 2017) - A 90-player game about the arrival of aliens on Earth that ran at NDSU in Fargo, ND. Players took on roles as heads of state, military commanders, scientists, journalists, and even the aliens themselves in this day-long event of diplomacy, strategy, and crisis management.

**Sickle: A Scythe Megagame** (June 8, 2019) - A 78-player megagame about diplomacy, intrigue, and war set in the World of 1920+, introduced by the award-winning board game Scythe. Players represented characters from seven nations attempting to earn their fortune and claim their stake in the lands surrounding the mysterious Factory. Held at West Acres in Fargo, with 100% of profits donated to Sanford Children's Hospital via Extra Life.

**Megagame Coalition Collaborations** - Multiple collaborations with the Megagame Coalition (MGC) across the continent, notably at GEN CON in Indianapolis for the better part of a decade.
