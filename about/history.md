# Our History

Prairie Fire Gaming has been creating memorable megagame experiences since 2017:

## Watch the Skies: Fargo (December 2017)

A 54-player game about the arrival of aliens on Earth that ran in Fargo, ND. Players took on roles as heads of state, military commanders, scientists, journalists, and even the aliens themselves in this day-long event of diplomacy, strategy, and crisis management.

## Sickle (2019)

Our take on political intrigue and strategy in a Cold War-era megagame.

## Megagame Coalition Collaborations

Multiple collaborations with the **Megagame Coalition (MGC)** across the continent, notably at Gen Con in Indianapolis for the better part of a decade. We've been proud partners in bringing the megagame format to gaming conventions and communities throughout North America.
