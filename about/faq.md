# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a megagame?

A megagame is a large-scale social game that blends elements of role-playing, strategy, and board game mechanics. These immersive events are day-long experiences where dozens of players take on unique roles, working together and competing to shape the outcome of epic scenarios. Whether you're playing as a head of state, a military commander, a scientist, a journalist, or even an alien invader, every role is crucial to the experience.

Megagames typically run for 4-8 hours and can accommodate anywhere from 30 to 200 players. Think of it as a hybrid between a tabletop game, a LARP, and a Model UN simulation—but way more fun.

## Who can play a megagame?

Anyone! No experience necessary—we welcome both veteran gamers and newcomers. Most of our games are appropriate for ages 14 and up, though some games may have different age requirements. We design our events with multiple gameplay styles to ensure there's something for everyone.

## Are you _sure_ megagmes aren't just for nerds & weirdos?

Absolutely sure. Players who play in Megagames run the gamut from die-hard _I-play-Warhammer-weekly_ grognards to _I-haven't-touched-a-playing-card-since-that-last-game-of-Candy-Land-in-first-grade_ normies.

Megagames are for everyone!

## What should I bring to a megagame?

Check out our [For Players](/about/for-players/) page for a comprehensive guide!

The basics: yourself, an open mind, and something to eat and drink. We'll provide everything else you need to play.

## Do I have to have a group of friends to play a megagame?

Not at all! While some games have team-based structures internally-and we try to group friends together if desired-many of our players are solo and make friends during the event. Part of the megagame magic is meeting new people who share your love of epic storytelling and total chaos.

## What information can I expect about the game?

When you register for a game, you'll receive a confirmation email with initial details. Roughly 1-3 weeks before the event, you'll be emailed your role assignment (if applicable), a copy of the rules, and any other resources you need to prepare.

## Why don't you send the rules out right away?

Megagame rules often vary depending on the role a player is assigned. Because roles (and sometimes even entire in-game factions, teams, nations, ships, you-name-it) change based on final player count, we wait until ticket sales are largely settled before sending out the full ruleset.

This lets us tailor the rules to the actual structure of the game you'll be playing, avoids confusion from last-minute changes, and ensures everyone receives information that's accurate and relevant to their role.

## Do I need to be good at _&lt;insert-skill-here&gt;_ to have fun?
Nope! Megagames welcome all skill levels--enthusiasm is the only requirement.

## When is your next game?

Check out our [Megagames page](../megagames/) for upcoming events! We announce new games via email, our social media channels, and on this website.

## How can I get involved in helping run games?

We love passionate volunteers! The best way to get involved is to play a game first, then chat with us afterward about your interest in crewing or game running.

You can also reach out directly at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com).

## I want to design and run a game, can you help?

Yes! We're always interested in supporting new designers. Whether you need playtesting, production support, or just advice, get in touch. We can discuss how Prairie Fire Gaming might be able to help bring your megagame vision to life.

## I don't see my accessibility needs catered for, but I still want to play. What should I do?

Please let us know! We're passionate about bringing megagames to as wide an audience as possible, and we're always willing to work on solutions. Review our [Accessibility policy](../policies/accessibility/) and reach out to us at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com) to discuss your specific needs.
