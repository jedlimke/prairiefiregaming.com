# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a megagame?

A megagame is a large-scale social game that blends elements of role-playing, strategy, and board game mechanics. These immersive events are day-long experiences where dozens of players take on unique roles, working together and competing to shape the outcome of epic scenarios. Whether you're playing as a head of state, a military commander, a scientist, a journalist, or even an alien invader, every role—and what **you** bring to it—is crucial to the experience.

Megagames typically run for 4–8 hours and can accommodate anywhere from 30 to 200 players. Think of it as a hybrid between a tabletop game, a costume party, and a _Model UN_ simulation—but _way more fun._

## Who can play a megagame?

Anyone! No experience necessary—we welcome both veteran gamers and newcomers. Most of our games are appropriate for ages 14 and up, though some games may have different age requirements. We design our events with multiple gameplay styles to ensure there's something for everyone.

## Are you _sure_ megagmes aren't just for nerds & weirdos?

Absolutely sure. Players who play in Megagames run the gamut from die-hard _I-play-Warhammer-weekly_ grognards to _I-haven't-touched-a-board-game-since-my-last-round-of-Candy-Land-in-first-grade_ normies.

Megagames are for everyone!

## What should I bring to a megagame?

Check out our [comprehensive guide](/about/for-players/)!

## Do I have to have a group of friends to play a megagame?

Not at all! While some games have team-based structures internally—and we try to group friends together if desired—many of our players are solo and make friends during the event.

A big part of megagame magic is meeting new people who are in the same boat as you, navigating the chaos.

## Must I be good at _&lt;insert-skill-here&gt;_ to have fun?

Nope! Megagames welcome all skill levels—enthusiasm is the only requirement.

## What information can I expect about the game?

When you register for a game, you'll receive a confirmation email with initial details. Roughly 1-3 weeks before the event, you'll be emailed your role assignment (if applicable), a copy of the rules, and any other resources you need to prepare.

## Why don't you send the materials out right away?

Megagame rules & materials often vary depending on the role a player is assigned. Because roles (and sometimes even entire in-game factions, teams, nations, ships, you-name-it) change based on final player count, we wait until ticket sales are largely settled before sending out the full ruleset.

This lets us tailor the rules to the actual structure of the game you'll be playing, avoids confusion from last-minute changes, and ensures everyone receives information that's accurate and relevant to their role.

## When is your next game?

Check out our [Megagames page](../megagames/) for upcoming events! We announce new games via email, our social media channels, and on this website.

## How can I get involved in helping run games?

We love passionate volunteers! The best way to get involved is to play a game first, then chat with us afterward about your interest in crewing or game running.

You can also reach out directly at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com).

## I want to design and run a game, can you help?

Yes! We're always interested in supporting new designers. Whether you need playtesting, production support, or just advice, get in touch. We can discuss how Prairie Fire Gaming might be able to help bring your megagame vision to life.

## Do you have any official policies regarding accessibility, safety, media, etc.?

You can read all of those policies and more at [Policies](../policies/).
