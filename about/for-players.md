# Megagame Survival Guide

<div class="callout" markdown="1" data-label="First Timer?">
### Don't Worry About "Doing It Right"
There's no single correct way to play a megagame. Your role is to engage with the game world and make interesting choices.

### It's Okay to Be Confused
Megagames can be overwhelming at first. Take a breath, ask questions, and trust that clarity will come as you play.

### Focus on Your Immediate Goals
Don't try to understand everything at once. Look through the game materials, talk to your teammates, and ask them what to try next.

### Make Friends
You're going to be spending hours with these people. Introduce yourself, be friendly, and remember: everyone else is figuring it out too.

### Embrace the Chaos
Things will go wrong. Plans will fall apart. Alliances will betray you. That's not a bug—it's a feature. Roll with it and enjoy the ride.

## Before the Game

- **Register Early** - Games can fill up fast! Sign up as soon as tickets are available to secure your spot, and **be sure to invite your friends along, too!**

- **Check Your Email** - We will email you everything you need to know before the game! Make sure you check your email frequently and reach out if you're not sure.

- **Read Your Materials** - You'll typically receive your role and rules about a week before the game, but earlier if the game sells out earlier. Take time to read through everything—you don't need to memorize it all, but familiarity helps you hit the ground running.

## What to Bring

- **Yourself** - The most important component
- **An open mind** - Be ready to adapt and improvise
- **A water bottle** - Stay hydrated during the long day
- **Food** - We recommend bringing something substantial to eat, as well as snacks to get you through the day. We often host games at venues that have nearby food, so check that out ahead of time and make a plan. Just don't megagame hangry.
- **Any required materials** - We'll let you know if you need to bring anything specific


### Leave at Home
- **Expectations of "winning"** - Megagames are about the journey and the story
- **Your phone** (figuratively) - While not banned, stay present in the game
- **Competitive stress** - This is collaborative storytelling, not a zero-sum competition

## What to Wear

Costumes are highly encouraged at megagames, and often very popular... but definitely, _definitely_ wear comfortable shoes.

Some games come with a costume or fashion guide, but ultimately you should wear whatever is most comfortable.

You **never** _have_ to cosplay for a megagme.

If you _want_ to, though, we hope you will.

Check our [Safety Policy](/policies/safety-policy/) to learn more about general costume guidelines.

Wear comfortable shoes. Dress however you like. Costumes are fun but never required.

## During the Game

- **Arrive Early** - Get there 15-30 minutes before start time. This gives you time to check in, find your table, meet your team, and settle in before the chaos begins.

- **Listen to the Briefing** - Gamerunners will explain the rules, answer questions, and set the scene. Pay attention—this is crucial information.

- **Engage with Others** - Talk to people! Make deals, form alliances, negotiate treaties. Social interaction is the heart of a megagame.

- **Ask Questions** - Confused about a rule? Not sure what you should be doing? Find a gamerunner. We're here to help.

- **Take Breaks** - It's a long day. Use the bathroom, stretch your legs, grab a snack. The game will still be there when you get back. We'll structure some into the game periodically, too.

- **Stay in Bounds** - Respect the rules, the space, and other players. Review our [Safety Policy](/policies/safety-policy/) before attending.

- **Have Fun** - Seriously. Succeed or fail, the goal is to create memorable stories together.

## After the Game

- **Debrief** - Stick around for our post-game debrief. This'll be an opportunity to hear from the gamerunners about what actually happened in the game as a whole and to share highlights. **Sharing stories with other players is half the fun.**

- **Post-game Hangout** - In all likelihood, the gamerunners will head somewhere nearby to eat, drink, and decompress. Join us if you'd like to be part of a longer chat about chaos of the day.

- **Share Your Experience** - Post photos (with permission), share stories on social media, and tell your friends. Help us grow the megagame community!

- **Give Feedback** - We want to hear what worked and what didn't. Your feedback helps us improve future events. We'll circulate feedback forms at the end of the game.

- **Stay Connected** - Join our social media channels, sign up for our email list, and mark your calendar for the next game.

## Common Questions

### What if I don't understand my role?
Ask a gamerunner during setup or early in the game. We'll help clarify.

### What if my team isn't getting along?
Try to work it out in-character first, but if it becomes a real problem, talk to a gamerunner.

### Can I leave early?
Life happens. If you need to leave before the game ends, let your team and a gamerunner know.

### What if someone is making me uncomfortable?**
Tell a gamerunner immediately. Review our [Safety Policy](policies/safety-policy/) for more details on how we handle these situations.

### Do I need to be good at acting/strategy/negotiation?
Nope! Megagames welcome all skill levels. You'll get better with experience, but enthusiasm is the only requirement.
