# Refund & Cancellation Policy

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
We don't issue refunds. Events are inherently risky—things happen, plans change, and sometimes games don't work out the way we hope. By registering, you're accepting that risk alongside us.
</div>

## No Refunds

Prairie Fire Gaming does not offer refunds for event registration. When you sign up for a megagame, you're committing to participate, and we're committing resources to make it happen—venue deposits, materials, planning, and coordination all happen based on your registration.

## If You Can't Attend

Life happens. If you can't make it to an event, we encourage you to:

- **Transfer your spot** - Find someone to take your place and let us know
- **Reach out early** - The sooner you let us know, the more options we might have
- **Stay in touch** - We'll do our best to work with you on future events

## If We Cancel

If Prairie Fire Gaming cancels an event, we'll work with you on one of the following:

- **Reschedule** - Transfer your registration to the new date
- **Credit** - Apply your registration to a future Prairie Fire Gaming event
- **Refund** - In the rare case we can't reschedule or you can't attend future events

## Event Experience

Here's the thing about megagames: they're incredibly diverse.

You probably like board games, but you don't like _every_ board game you've ever played, right?

**Same deal here.**

Megagames vary wildly in theme, mechanics, tone, and style. Some are intense political simulations, others are chaotic sci-fi adventures, and some are experimental things nobody's tried before. If a megagame you participated in just didn't click, that doesn't mean megagames aren't for you—it might just mean this one wasn't your style.

We hope you'll love whatever game you play with us... _but we can't promise you will._

Not enjoying an event isn't grounds for a refund. We appreciate feedback and want to keep improving, but the experimental nature of these events means experiences vary. We encourage you to try different ones and find what you like.

## Case-by-Case Considerations

We're humans running events for humans. If you have exceptional circumstances, reach out to us at [info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com). We'll listen and do what we can, but we can't make promises.
