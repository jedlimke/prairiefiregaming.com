# Accessibility

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
We want our events to be accessible to as many people as possible. If you need accommodations, contact us at least **two weeks before the event** and we'll do our best to help. That said, we're a small volunteer organization with limited resources—we can't guarantee we'll be able to meet every need.
</div>

## Our Approach

Prairie Fire Gaming is committed to making our events welcoming and accessible, but we need to be honest about our limitations. We're not a large organization or government entity—we're a small group of volunteers organizing complex events, often in venues we don't control.

## What We Need From You

If you need accommodations, please:

- **Contact us early** - At least two weeks before the event, ideally when you register
- **Be specific** - Tell us exactly what you need so we can assess what's possible
- **Be flexible** - We may not be able to provide exactly what you're asking for, but we'll work with you on alternatives
- **Be understanding** - Sometimes the answer will be "we can't do that," and we need you to respect that limitation

## What We Can (and Can't) Do

**We can often help with:**
- Seating arrangements and table accessibility
- Communicating with venues about physical accessibility
- Providing printed materials in larger fonts
- Working with you on dietary restrictions (where possible with catering)
- Adjusting game roles or responsibilities to fit different needs

**We probably can't:**
- Modify core game mechanics or principles
- Redesign venues or game spaces we don't control
- Guarantee allergen-free environments (we can't control what other participants bring)
- Provide personal assistants or one-on-one support beyond the usual for anyone playing the game in question
- Accommodate requests made less than two weeks out

<div class="callout important" markdown="1" data-label="Important">
All of our events are held in third-party venues. We don't control building accessibility, parking, restrooms, or environmental factors. We encourage you to research the venue independently and contact us with specific concerns.
</div>

## Our Commitment

We'll always listen, consider your needs, and do what we reasonably can within our resources and constraints. If we can't accommodate you, we'll tell you honestly and as early as possible so you can make an informed decision about playing.
