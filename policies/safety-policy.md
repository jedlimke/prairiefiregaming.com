# Safety Policy

## Purpose
**Prairie Fire Gaming** is dedicated to providing a safe environment where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Harassment or unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, visual, or in any other form, is strictly prohibited. This policy applies to all persons involved in the operation or attendance of any venue or event in which Prairie Fire Gaming is involved. Prairie Fire Gaming will not tolerate harassment of anyone, by anyone, including participants, vendors, hosts, or staff.

## Respectful Conflict
The games we play often revolve around disagreement, and respectful conflict can lead to productive results; but these must be offered in good faith. Every participant's intention at all times should be a positive experience for all involved.

## Definition of Harassment
Prairie Fire Gaming defines harassment as any behavior that threatens a person or group or produces an unsafe or non-inclusive environment. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, age, or religious beliefs.

## Examples of Harassment
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Sexual or discriminatory images in public and quasi-public spaces (online and offline)
- Intimidation, stalking, following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Discriminatory or insensitive jokes, teasing, or epithets
- Display or discussion of offensive written or graphic material
- Repeatedly standing too close to or brushing against a person
- Giving gifts of an unwanted or sexual nature

Advocating for or encouraging any of the above is also considered harassment.

## Reporting and Response
No one should tolerate conduct of this type. If you experience or witness harassment, you may:
- If safe, ask the offender to stop.
- Leave the area.
- Ask a Prairie Fire Gaming staff member for help.
- Contact the police or other authorities.

You may also make a confidential report by emailing **[info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com)** or speaking to an Event Lead. Reports will be handled confidentially and without retaliation against good faith complainants.

## Prairie Fire Gaming Response
Prairie Fire Gaming reserves the right to take immediate and appropriate action, including but not limited to:
- Reviewing reported incidents.
- Issuing formal warnings.
- Removing offenders from the premises without refund.
- Imposing permanent bans from future Prairie Fire Gaming events.
- Contacting law enforcement.

## Code of Conduct
Prairie Fire Gaming's policies apply in all physical and online spaces within Prairie Fire Gaming's control, including event venues, social media, Discord servers, and online events. Venue or host organization policies may also apply and, in some cases, take precedence.

## Out-of-Scope Behavior
Prairie Fire Gaming may consider actions that occur outside its events when those actions pose a risk to participant safety or could contribute to a hostile environment at Prairie Fire Gaming activities. Examples include:
- Individuals with a history of abusive behavior, even if incidents occurred outside Prairie Fire Gaming.
- Prairie Fire Gaming participants reported for conduct at other conventions, abusive online behavior, or assault.

## Interpersonal Conflicts
Some disagreements or interpersonal conflicts do not rise to harassment or abuse. Prairie Fire Gaming will not arbitrate such disputes—participants are asked to leave these conflicts at home.

## Continuous Improvement
Prairie Fire Gaming strives to maintain a safe and welcoming environment. Suggestions for improvement may be sent to **[info@prairiefiregaming.com](mailto:info@prairiefiregaming.com)**.
