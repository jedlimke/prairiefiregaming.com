# Megagame Survival Guide

## Before the Game

### Register Early
Games fill up fast! Sign up as soon as tickets are available to secure your spot.

### Read Your Materials
You'll receive your role and rules 2-3 weeks before the game. Take time to read through everything—you don't need to memorize it all, but familiarity helps you hit the ground running.

### Check Your Email
Important updates, last-minute rule clarifications, and venue details will be sent via email in the days leading up to the event.

### Prepare Your Character (If Applicable)
Some games involve role-playing specific characters. If yours does, think about your character's motivations, goals, and personality. Light costuming is always welcome but never required.

## What to Bring

### Essential Items
- **Yourself** - The most important component
- **An open mind** - Be ready to adapt and improvise
- **A pen or pencil** - You'll be taking notes, signing treaties, making deals
- **A water bottle** - Stay hydrated during the long day
- **Snacks** - While we often provide light refreshments, bring your own supplies to keep your energy up
- **Any required materials** - We'll let you know if you need to bring anything specific

### Optional But Helpful
- **Notepad** - For tracking deals, alliances, and betrayals
- **Lunch money** - Some venues have nearby food options
- **Comfortable clothes** - You'll be on your feet and moving around
- **Character costume pieces** - If you want to get into character (check game guidelines)
- **Business cards** - Great for in-game networking or making real-life connections

### Leave at Home
- **Expectations of "winning"** - Megagames are about the journey and the story
- **Your phone** (mostly) - While not banned, stay present in the game
- **Competitive stress** - This is collaborative storytelling, not a zero-sum competition

## During the Game

### Arrive Early
Get there 15-30 minutes before start time. This gives you time to check in, find your seat, meet your team, and settle in before the chaos begins.

### Listen to the Briefing
Game runners will explain the rules, answer questions, and set the scene. Pay attention—this is crucial information.

### Engage with Others
Talk to people! Make deals, form alliances, negotiate treaties. The social interaction is the heart of a megagame.

### Ask Questions
Confused about a rule? Not sure what you should be doing? Find a game runner (usually wearing distinctive clothing or badges). We're here to help.

### Take Breaks
It's a long day. Use the bathroom, stretch your legs, grab a snack. The game will still be there when you get back.

### Stay in Bounds
Respect the rules, the space, and other players. Review our [Safety Policy](policies/safety-policy/) before attending.

### Have Fun
Seriously. Win or lose, succeed or fail, the goal is to create memorable stories together.

## After the Game

### Decompress
Megagames are intense! Give yourself time to process the experience.

### Debrief
Stick around for the post-game discussion if time allows. Sharing stories with other players is half the fun.

### Share Your Experience
Post photos (with permission), share stories on social media, and tell your friends. Help us grow the megagame community!

### Give Feedback
We want to hear what worked and what didn't. Your feedback helps us improve future events.

### Stay Connected
Join our social media channels, sign up for our email list, and mark your calendar for the next game.

## Tips for First-Time Players

### Don't Worry About "Doing It Right"
There's no single correct way to play a megagame. Your role is to engage with the game world and make interesting choices.

### It's Okay to Be Confused
Megagames can be overwhelming at first. Take a breath, ask questions, and trust that clarity will come as you play.

### Focus on Your Immediate Goals
Don't try to understand everything at once. Look at your role sheet, identify your next objective, and work on that.

### Make Friends
You're going to be spending hours with these people. Introduce yourself, be friendly, and remember: everyone else is figuring it out too.

### Embrace the Chaos
Things will go wrong. Plans will fall apart. Alliances will betray you. That's not a bug—it's a feature. Roll with it and enjoy the ride.

## Common Questions

**What if I don't understand my role?**
Ask a game runner during setup or early in the game. We'll help clarify.

**What if my team isn't getting along?**
Try to work it out in-character first, but if it becomes a real problem, talk to a game runner.

**Can I leave early?**
Life happens. If you need to leave before the game ends, let your team and a game runner know.

**What if someone is making me uncomfortable?**
Tell a game runner immediately. Review our [Safety Policy](policies/safety-policy/) for more details on how we handle these situations.

**Do I need to be good at acting/strategy/negotiation?**
Nope! Megagames welcome all skill levels. You'll get better with experience, but enthusiasm is the only requirement.
