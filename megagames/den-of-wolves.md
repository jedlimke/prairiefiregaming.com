60 players! 6 hours! 100% fun! Inspired by the pilot of _Battlestar Galactica_, **Den of Wolves** is a cooperative megagame that combines elements of board games and diplomacy. Players cooperate to allocate resources while fending off waves of attacks from the vile "wolves". Beware! These wolves are tricky, and a traitor may roam amongst us.

# Den of Wolves: Infinite Domain

**Den of Wolves: Infinite Domain** is an expansion to the original Den of Wolves which increases the player count and incorporates new ships as well as several bonus roles.

## March 7, 2026 at West Acres

Prairie Fire Gaming is proud to present Den of Wolves - the modern megagame classic by the UK upstart designer, John Mizon of [SW Megagames](https://www.swmegagames.co.uk/den-of-wolves).

Den of Wolves is one of the most-played megagames of all time, sporting strong themes common in military sci-fi (like the Alien series or The Expanse) and satisfying resource management mechanics. Folks familiar with the pilot of Battlestar Galactica will find very similar themes and setting.

## The Setting

A small fleet of interstellar vessels tries to balance survival, politics and military challenges as they attempt to stay one step ahead of their pursuers.

It is the 27th Century. After a catastrophic attack on humanity, one battleship and a few civilian vessels must fight to survive, govern themselves and maintain order, as they flee from their pursuers. Den of Wolves is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets – however, talking and negotiating with other players will be crucial in order to achieve success. The game also seeks to represent political and military systems, and their decisions, and so players should expect some political simulation.

Beware! There may be secret traitorous roles among us!
