# Den of Wolves

**March 7, 2026 · Fargo · 6 Hours · 60 Players**

Humanity is on the run.

A catastrophic attack has left you with one warship and a handful of civilian vessels fleeing into deep space. The enemy—the "wolves"—are relentless, closing in from behind. Resources are scarce. Trust is scarcer. And somewhere among your crew... there might be a traitor.

**Den of Wolves** is a cooperative megagame about survival under pressure. You'll manage resources, make impossible political decisions, and negotiate with other players to keep the fleet alive. Think _Battlestar Galactica_ meets high-stakes board gaming meets live-action chaos.

You might be a ship captain coordinating with engineers to keep the lights on. You might be a politician arguing over who gets the last supply of fuel. You might be military personnel tracking enemy movements. Or you might be the wolf—sabotaging everything from within.

One of the most-played megagames of all time. Designed by John Mizon of [SW Megagames](https://www.swmegagames.co.uk/den-of-wolves).

## What You'll Do

**Manage Resources** — Fuel, ammunition, food, medicine. Every decision matters when supplies are limited and the fleet keeps moving.

**Make Political Decisions** — Who gets rescued? Where do we jump next? Do we trust the intel? You'll debate, negotiate, and vote on the fleet's survival.

**Fight or Flight** — Military teams coordinate defense. Engineering teams keep ships operational. Medical teams treat casualties. Everyone has a job. Not everyone survives.

**Trust No One** — Traitors exist. They're hidden. They're working against you. Or maybe they're not. Paranoia is part of the experience.

## What You Need to Know

- **No experience required** — Rules will be sent via email and taught at the start. You'll learn as you play.
- **Cosplay encouraged** — Come as a ship captain, a politician, a refugee. Or just wear comfortable clothes. Either works.
- **Age limit: 16+ with adult, otherwise 18+** — This is a long, intense game with mature themes.
