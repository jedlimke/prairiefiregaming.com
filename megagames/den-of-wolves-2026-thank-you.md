## What Happens Next?

### Complete the Pre-Game Casting Survey

This is how we will know how to assign you to a team and a role in the fleet. The survey is filled with background information on ships, nations, and roles.

It should take just under 10 minutes to complete. You'll also have a chance to mention who you want to be teamed-up with... and talk about any _traitorous_ thoughts you may be having.
