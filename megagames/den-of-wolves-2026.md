Humanity is on the run.

A catastrophic attack has left you with one warship and a handful of civilian vessels fleeing into deep space. The enemy—the "wolves"—are relentless, closing in from behind. Resources are scarce. Trust is scarcer. And somewhere among your crew... there might be a traitor.

**Den of Wolves** is a cooperative megagame about survival under pressure. You'll manage resources, make impossible political decisions, and negotiate with other players to keep the fleet alive. Think _Battlestar Galactica_ meets high-stakes board gaming meets live-action chaos.

You might be a ship captain coordinating with engineers to keep the lights on. You might be a politician arguing over who gets the last supply of fuel. You might be military personnel tracking enemy movements. Or you might be the wolf—sabotaging everything from within.

## What You'll Do

**Manage Resources** — Fuel, ammunition, food, medicine. Every decision matters when supplies are limited and the fleet keeps moving.

**Make Political Decisions** — Who gets rescued? Where do we jump next? Do we trust the intel? You'll debate, negotiate, and vote on the fleet's survival.

**Fight or Flight** — Military teams coordinate defense. Engineering teams keep ships operational. Medical teams treat casualties. Everyone has a job. Not everyone survives.

**Trust No One** — Traitors exist. They're hidden. They're working against you. Or maybe they're not. Paranoia is part of the experience.

## What You Need to Know

- **No experience required** — Rules will be sent via email and taught at the start. You'll learn as you play.
- **Cosplay encouraged** — Come as a ship captain, a politician, a refugee. Or just wear comfortable clothes. Either works.
- **Age limit: 16+ with adult, otherwise 18+** — This is a long, intense game with mature themes and a lot of stress (the fun kind).
- **There'll be a lunch break** — Megagames require sustenance! We'll be at _West Acres_ so snacks and meals will be available from the food court if desired. You can also pack your own or have something delivered! __Just no booze!__
- **Player elimination is NOT a thing** — Character death is real. Player elimination is not. You'll get a new role or be reshuffled somehow if your _character_ bites it, but **you** get to keep playing. _Take a chance now and then._
- **We're aiming for a full 60 players** — Our past games have sold out, but we never take that for granted. If you know someone who'd love this, bring them along!
