Humanity is on the run.

A catastrophic attack has left you with one warship and a handful of civilian vessels fleeing into deep space. The enemy—the "wolves"—are relentless, closing in from behind. Resources are scarce. Trust is scarcer. And somewhere among your crew... **there might be a traitor.**

**Den of Wolves** is a 60-player MEGAGAME that places you among the decision-makers of a desperate, fractured fleet as it flees into deep space after a devastating attack. You're not a lone hero, but one voice among many, forced to coordinate, compromise, and act under pressure as the enemies close in from behind. You'll manage resources, make impossible political decisions, and negotiate with other players to keep the fleet alive. Think _Battlestar Galactica_ meets diplomacy meets roleplaying meets high-stakes board gaming meets live-action chaos.

You might be a ship captain coordinating with engineers to keep the lights on. You might be a politician arguing over who gets the last supply of fuel. You might be military personnel tracking enemy movements. Or you might be the wolf—sabotaging everything from within.

## What You'll Do

<div class="gameplay-pillars">
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Manage Resources</h3>
    <p>Fuel, water, food, medicine. Every decision matters when supplies are limited and the fleet keeps moving.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">You can't thrive if you don't survive.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Make Political Decisions</h3>
    <p>Who gets rescued? Where do we jump next? Do we trust the intel? You'll debate, negotiate, and vote on the fleet's survival.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">Your actions matter.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Fight or Flight</h3>
    <p>Military teams coordinate defense. Engineering teams keep ships operational. Medical teams treat casualties. Everyone has a job.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">Not everyone is happy about it.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Trust No One</h3>
    <p>Traitors exist. They're hidden. They're working against you. Or maybe they're not.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">Paranoia is part of the experience.</p>
  </div>

## What You Need to Know

- **No experience required** — Rules will be sent via email and taught at the start. You'll learn as you play.
- **Cosplay encouraged** — Come dressed as your character if you want! Military uniform? Civilian refugee? Ship captain? Engineer's coveralls? It's all up to you and your shipmates' creativity. Or just wear comfortable clothes—either works.
- **Role selection** — You'll know which ship you're assigned to before gameday, but your specific role within that crew is up to you and your shipmates to decide together. Most ships have a Captain, First Officer, Chief Engineer, and Council Member, plus ship-specific roles like Chief Scientist or Head Surgeon. Negotiate, volunteer, or let the group decide—just like real humans under pressure.
- **There might be traitors in the fleet** — There's intrigue within the game where some crew members might secretly be wolves in human suits! We know not everyone enjoys the stress of being so duplicitous, however, so you can absolutely opt out without worry if you're asked.
- **Age limit: 16+ with adult, otherwise 18+** — This is a long, intense game with mature themes and a lot of stress (the fun kind).
- **There'll be a lunch break** — Megagames require sustenance! We'll be at _West Acres_ so snacks and meals will be available from the food court if desired. You can also pack your own or have something delivered! __Just no booze!__
- **Player elimination is NOT a thing** — Character death is real—a ship may get destroyed or a political rival may be assassinated—but _player_ elimination is not something to worry about. You'll get a new role or be reshuffled somehow if your _character_ bites it, but **you** get to keep playing. _Take a chance now and then._
- **We're aiming for 60 players** — Our past games have sold out, but we never take that for granted. If you know someone who'd love this, bring them along!
