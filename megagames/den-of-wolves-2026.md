Humanity is on the run.

A catastrophic attack has left you with one warship and a handful of civilian vessels fleeing into deep space. The enemy—the "wolves"—are relentless, closing in from behind. Resources are scarce. Trust is scarcer. And somewhere among your crew... **there might be a traitor.**

**Den of Wolves** is a 60-player MEGAGAME that places you among the decision-makers of a desperate, fractured fleet as it flees into deep space after a devastating attack. You're not a lone hero, but one voice among many, forced to coordinate, compromise, and act under pressure as the enemies close in from behind. You'll manage resources, make impossible political decisions, and negotiate with other players to keep the fleet alive.

Think _Battlestar Galactica_ meets diplomacy meets roleplaying meets high-stakes board gaming meets live-action chaos.

You might be a ship captain coordinating with engineers to keep the lights on. You might be a politician arguing over who gets the last supply of fuel. You might be military personnel tracking enemy movements. Or you might be the wolf—sabotaging everything from within.

## What You'll Do

<div class="gameplay-pillars">
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Manage Resources</h3>
    <p>Fuel, water, food, medicine. Every decision matters when supplies are limited and the fleet keeps moving.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">You can't thrive if you don't survive.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Make Political Decisions</h3>
    <p>Who gets rescued? Where do we jump next? Do we trust the intel? You'll debate, negotiate, and vote on the fleet's survival.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">Your actions matter.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Fight or Flight</h3>
    <p>Military teams coordinate defense. Engineering teams keep ships operational. Medical teams treat casualties. Everyone has a job.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">Not everyone is happy about it.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="pillar-card">
    <h3>Trust No One</h3>
    <p>Traitors exist. They're hidden. They're working against you. Or maybe they're not.</p>
    <p class="pillar-tagline fancy-text">Paranoia is part of the experience.</p>

		<h4>Federated Atlantic Syndicate (FAS)</h4>
        <p>The FAS long defined itself by financial power and a relentless need to demonstrate its own superiority. Whatever financial infrastructure backed that power is now ash. But the FAS's talent for diplomacy and political maneuvering—honed over centuries—translates readily to the new Council chambers aboard the <em>Dione</em>, which is itself a former FAS vessel now repurposed as the seat of government. Old habits die hard, and old grudges die harder: the FAS resentment toward Rosal, the first colony to break free, hasn't faded just because the world has ended.</p>

		<h4>Confederated Peoples of Asia (CPA)</h4>
        <p>The CPA was the government of most of the East Asian landmass, built on a strong emphasis on national identity and collective purpose. Long rivals of the FAS, the centuries had pulled the two into an uneasy alignment as the New Nations rose. But the CPA's defining wound predates all of that: Wolf 1061 was a mostly CPA-held system when the Wolf War of Independence broke out—and the Wolves showed little mercy to her soldiers and citizens there. Though WWI eventually drew in every nation, the CPA paid the steepest price... and the Attack has ripped that old scar wide open. For the CPA survivors now aboard the <em>Icebreaker</em> and <em>Fuerza Leon</em>, grief and fury are never far from the surface.</p>

        <p>The historic nations of Central and South America combined to form the SAN, and were long-standing political allies of the CPA, bound together by a common wariness of the FAS. As the New Nations rose, that old solidarity faded, and the SAN found itself more focused on simply having a voice among louder, more powerful neighbors. In the Survivor Fleet, SAN civilians are concentrated aboard the <em>Lucas</em> and the <em>Salvador</em>—a water-supply vessel and a hospital ship. Quieter than the others in the old politics, the SAN now finds its people doing some of the most essential work in the fleet.</p>

        <p>One of the earliest planets to be colonized, Rosal was also the first to win independence—through a violent war against FAS rule, followed by treaties with the CPA and SAN that formalized their sovereignty in exchange for economic concessions. They've never let anyone forget it. Rosal is loud in the Council, unafraid to challenge Old or New Nations alike when they believe a wrong is being done. In the Survivor Fleet, Rosal's civilians are concentrated aboard the <em>Shepherd</em> and the <em>Endeavour</em>. That independent streak—the one that started a war of liberation centuries ago—is still very much alive.</p>

		<h4>Proxima</h4>
        <p>Settlement on Proxima B began around the same time as Rosal, but independence came much later and with far less bloodshed—primarily a sweeping political change driven by garrison forces who saw themselves as Proximans first. That individualistic streak runs deep and has always created friction with more diplomatically minded nations. In the Survivor Fleet, Proxima's people are aboard the <em>Quellon</em> and the <em>Vulcan</em>—the latter a prison transport whose arrival caused no shortage of controversy. Proxima's self-reliance can be an asset in a crisis. Whether it translates to cooperation is another question.</p>

		<h4>Gliese</h4>
        <p>Gliese's history has always been defined by what lies beneath its surface. The planet of Gliese 832C was quickly recognized by early scouts as a rich source of rare minerals, and it became one of the largest providers of strytium ore in known space. Independence came through a combination of violence and industrial action—Gliese didn't just fight for sovereignty, it fought for control of its own mines. In the Survivor Fleet, that expertise is existential: <em>Refinery 124</em>, crewed by Gliese workers, is the fleet's primary source of the strytium fuel that keeps it ahead of the Wolf Navy. Without Gliese, the fleet stops moving.</p>

        <p>The youngest of the New Nations, Helvetii was founded not through rebellion but through wandering—apolitical refugees from the wars of independence who drifted for decades before discovering an uncharted asteroid cluster rich in rare elements. Their constitution is built around neutrality, and they were regularly called upon to mediate when Council negotiations reached an impasse. In the Survivor Fleet, Helvetii's people crew the <em>Hephaestus</em> and the <em>Baltar</em>. Their neutrality is now the most complicated position in the fleet: when everything and everyone has been attacked, what does it mean to take no side?</p>

## What You Need to Know

- **No experience required** — Rules will be sent via email and taught at the start. You'll learn as you play.
- **Cosplay encouraged but not required** — Come dressed as your character if you want! Military uniform? Civilian refugee? Ship captain? Engineer's coveralls? It's all up to you and your shipmates' creativity. Or just wear comfortable clothes—either works.
- **Role selection** — You'll know which ship you're assigned to before gameday, but your specific role within that crew is up to you and your shipmates to decide together. Most ships have a Captain, First Officer, Chief Engineer, and Council Member, plus ship-specific roles like Chief Scientist or Head Surgeon.
- **There might be traitors in the fleet** — There's intrigue within the game where some crew members might secretly be wolves in human suits! We know not everyone enjoys the stress of being so duplicitous, however, so you can absolutely opt out without worry if you're asked.
- **Age limit: 14+ with adult, otherwise 18+** — This is a long, intense game with some fun stress along the way.
- **There'll be a lunch break** — Megagames require sustenance! We'll be at _West Acres_ so snacks and meals will be available from the food court if desired. You can also pack your own or have something delivered! __Just no booze!__
- **Player elimination is NOT a thing** — Character death is real—a ship may get destroyed or a political rival may be assassinated—but _player_ elimination is not something to worry about. You'll get a new role or be reshuffled somehow if your _character_ bites it, but **you** get to keep playing. _Take a chance now and then._
- **We're aiming for 60 players** — Our past games have sold out, but we never take that for granted. If you know someone who'd love this, bring them along!
